  <p class="description">The portrait of Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini, third wife
    of Francesco di Bartolommeo de Zenobi del Giocondo. She is seated in
    a chair on which her left arm rests, her right hand superposed on the
    left. She is turned three-quarters to her right. Her hair, divided
    in the centre and seen under a transparent veil, falls in curls on
    her shoulders; her dark almond-shaped eyes look out at the spectator;
    the mouth is smiling. She wears a dark-green dress with golden-brown
    sleeves; a dark cloak is draped over her shoulders. The background is
    formed by a mountainous landscape full of incident.<br /><br />

    Painted in tempera on panel, and restored in oil.<br /><br />

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THOSE who wish to make a thorough, comprehensive, and systematic study
    of the pictures of the great national collection contained in the
    Louvre, which extend from the early years of the fourteenth century
    down to almost the present day, will be well advised to deal with the
    artists by the countries, schools, and periods to which they belong.
    That is the scheme which we have followed here.</p>

    <p>We do not hesitate to refer to painters, especially those of the
    Italian schools, under the names by which they are generally known to
    modern critics, as opposed to those under which they are officially
    catalogued by the Louvre authorities. Thus, Raphael, Titian, and Giulio
    Romano, and not Santi, Vecelli, and Pippi, are the names which we shall
    use in this book. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the
    official attributions of a certain number of the pictures, mainly of
    the Italian schools, and notably several by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci,
    and Titian, are not accepted by us.</p>

  <p>The authors of any critical book on a large national collection which
    includes several hundred Italian paintings of varying importance
    must of necessity be under heavy obligations to Mr. Berenson, whose
    scholarly, scientific, and constructive criticism, following on that of
    Morelli, has entirely revolutionised the study of Italian art.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed that in many instances the dates used in these
    pages do not coincide with those given in the official Catalogues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> and
    repeated in a large number of text-books, while in a few cases it has
    been thought desirable to draw the attention of the student to the
    questionable accuracy of some of the titles and “pedigrees.”</p>

  <p>The illustrations which have been selected represent, as far as
    possible, the whole range of the art of each country and school
    comprised within the limits of the fifteenth to the nineteenth
    centuries. The Plates are arranged in the order in which reference is
    made to them in the text, but it has been found impossible to place
    them opposite the pages on which the critical remarks are given.</p>

  <p>In the descriptions of the pictures the terms <em>right</em> and <em>left</em> are
    used in reference to the right and left of the spectator, unless
    the text obviously implies the contrary. Moreover, in the titles of
    pictures containing the Madonna and several Saints, the names of the
    Saints are given in the order they occupy in the composition regarded
    from left to right. The titles we have used are descriptive rather than
    mere translations of those contained in the official Catalogue. The
    official numbers are those marked in large figures and placed at the
    top of the frames; the numbers in small figures affixed to the bottom
    left corner of some of the frames are obsolete.</p>

  <p>The surface measures of the pictures are for convenience given in feet
    and inches as well as in metres, the height preceding the width. The
    technical conditions as to panel or canvas and tempera or oil are also
    noted.</p>

  <p>Most of the Rooms containing pictures are open:—</p>

  <ol>
    <li>On Sundays all the year round, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</li>

    <li>On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from April 1 to
      September 30, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</li>

    <li>On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from October 1
      to March 31, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</li>

    <li>On Thursdays in the Summer Months, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and in the
      Winter Months, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. </li>

    <li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>Rooms IX.–XIII., which contain French pictures and Rooms
      XIX.–XXXV., which contain Flemish and Dutch pictures are not open
      before eleven o’clock.</li>

    <li>The Louvre is closed on Mondays all the year round, and on
      January 1, July 14, and Ascension Day; it is also closed on the
      Feast of the Assumption (August 15), All Saints Day (November 1),
      and Christmas Day, unless these last three days fall on a Sunday.</li>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TO form a just appreciation of the magnificent collection of paintings
    which the Louvre to-day contains would require an exhaustive study
    which might be spread over a term of years spent in the famous French
    capital itself. In the limited space at our disposal we can only
    touch lightly upon the historical events, the sociological causes,
    the grandeur of royalty, and the taste of the people, all of which
    contributed towards bringing about the formation of the great Musée
    National du Louvre as we now know it. It has been our endeavour to
    throw into prominent relief the outstanding features in the history
    of the Gallery and to sketch them in chronological order. The
    architectural claims of the building, its priceless collections of
    statuary and of <i lang="fr">objets d’art</i> of every age do not here immediately
    concern us; it is to the formation of the superb collection of
    paintings that we primarily desire to call our readers’ attention.</p>

  <p>A small part of the building which is to-day known as the Louvre was
    first occupied as a royal residence by Philippe-Auguste (reigned
    1180–1223), who converted a hunting-seat of the early French kings on
    this site into a feudal fortress with a strong <i lang="fr">donjon</i> or keep, the
    exact plan of which may still be traced by the white line marked since
    1868 on the pavement in the southwest corner of the old courtyard.
    Charles v. (reigned 1364–80), who may be regarded as the first royal
    collector of art treasures in France, greatly enlarged the building
    of the Old Louvre as a residential palace; he is also said to have
    decorated the building with statues and paintings which have long since
    disappeared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> The real foundations of the collection of <i lang="fr">la maison du
    Roi</i> were laid by François <span class="smcap">i.</span> (reigned 1515–47), who during
    his Italian campaigns acquired a respect for art that proved to be an
    honour to his taste and a dowry for his country. The æsthetic movement
    had developed rapidly by 1541, when he laid the foundations of the
    present palace<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and had already begun to form a collection of easel
    pictures. François <span class="smcap">i.</span> invited to his court the master-painter
    Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), who in 1516 left his native land
    for France, where he did the king little more than the compliment
    of dying in his realm, although not, as an unveracious tradition
    recounts, in his arms. Andrea del Sarto (1486–1531) was also employed
    at the French court, at which he arrived in 1518. Giovanni Battista
    Rosso (1494–1541), a painter of little genius but great ability, was
    summoned by François <span class="smcap">i.</span> in 1530 to decorate the Château at
    Fontainebleau. Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71), the Florentine goldsmith,
    having “determined to seek another country and better luck,” was yet
    one more artist who set out for France, where, between 1540 and 1544,
    he adorned the royal tables with objects precious in workmanship
    and material. Primaticcio (1504–70), who is known to have cleaned
    at Fontainebleau in 1530 four of the large reputed Raphaels now in
    the Louvre, remained at the French court until his death. The strict
    authenticity of these four pictures—<cite>The Holy Family of Francis I.</cite>
    (No. 1498), the <cite>St. Margaret</cite> (No. 1501), the large <cite>St. Michael</cite> (No.
    1504), and the <cite>Portrait of Joan of Arragon</cite> (No. 1507)—does not here
    concern us. François <span class="smcap">i.</span> also possessed at this date, among
    other notable pictures, Raphael’s <cite>La Belle Jardinière</cite> (No. 1496,
    <a href="#i_plate07">Plate VII.</a>), Leonardo <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>da Vinci’s <cite>Virgin of the Rocks</cite> (No. 1599), and
    the same artist’s <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> or <cite>La Joconde</cite> (No. 1601, <a href="#i_plate04">Plate IV.</a>),
    while the art of Sebastiano del Piombo, Andrea del Sarto, and other
    painters, Flemish as well as Italian, was well represented in the royal
    collection during his reign.</p>

  <div class="footnote" lang="fr"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a>
    “François <span class="smcap">i.</span> voulant avoir dans Paris un palais
    digne de sa magnificence et dédaignant le vieux Louvre et l’hôtel des
    Tournelles, amas irrégulier de <em>tournelles</em> (tourelles) et de pavillons
    gothiques, avait fait démolir, dès 1528, la grosse tour du Louvre,
    ce donjon de Philippe-Auguste duquel relevaient tous les fiefs du
    royaume. C’était démolir l’histoire elle-même; c’était la monarchie de
    la renaissance abattant la vieille royauté féodale.”—Martin, <cite>Hist. de France</cite>.
  </div>

  <p>The example set by François <span class="smcap">i.</span> was followed by his successor,
    Henri <span class="smcap">ii.</span> (reigned 1547–59), for whom Niccolò dell’ Abbate
    (1515–71), an artist of secondary importance, was working from 1552
    onwards. Henri <span class="smcap">ii.</span>’s queen, Catherine de Médicis, was also a
    patron of art, being herself a collector of coins and medals. To her
    influence was due the decoration of the Château of Fontainebleau and
    the erection of the Palace of the Tuileries,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which was subsequently
    connected with the Louvre by means of the Long Gallery, now Room VI.
    Her eldest son, François <span class="smcap">ii.</span> (reigned 1559–60), the husband of
    Mary Queen of Scots, first converted the new buildings of the Louvre
    into a royal residence. Henry <span class="smcap">iv.</span> (reigned 1589–1610) enlarged
    the Tuileries, and almost completed the Long Gallery, which now
    contains such a large proportion of the pictures. Louis <span class="smcap">xiii.</span>
    (reigned 1589–1610), his eldest son, seems to have taken little
    interest in the royal collection; but his mother, Marie de Médicis,
    invited Rubens (1577–1640) to Paris to decorate the Palace of the
    Luxembourg with that series of imposing canvases representing her own
    life-history which are to-day seen to their best advantage in the Salle
    Rubens (Room XVIII.) of the Louvre.</p>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a>
    An inscription on a tablet placed high up on the left of
    the Pavillon Sully records that François <span class="smcap">i.</span> began the Louvre
    in 1541, and Catherine de Médicis the Tuileries in 1564.</div>

  <p>No complete record has been found of the pictures which formed the
    royal collection previous to the year 1642. To that date belongs
    a meagre Catalogue of the objects of art which then remained at
    Fontainebleau, but it is supposed that when Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>
    (reigned 1643–1715) succeeded to the throne he in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>herited about one
    hundred pictures, the property of the Crown. With his accession a new
    era in the history of art in France began.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, across the water, a superb royal collection had been formed.
    Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span> of England (reigned 1625–49) had begun his career
    as a patron of art before his accession, with the acquisition of the
    paintings and statues collected by his deceased brother, Henry. During
    his matrimonial visit to Madrid in 1623 he was presented by Philip
    <span class="smcap">iv.</span> with Titian’s <cite>Venus del Pardo</cite>, now in the Louvre (No.
    1587). Soon after his accession he began to collect systematically,
    employing trusty agents to buy for him in different parts of Europe.
    His most notable purchase was that of the collection of the Duke of
    Mantua, for which he paid £18,280 between 1629 and 1632. He is said to
    have possessed in all 1760 pictures by the date of his execution. Most
    of them were disposed of at auction by order of Cromwell between 1649
    and 1652.</p>

  <p>One of the most persistent bidders at the sale of Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>’s
    pictures was Eberhard Jabach, a native of Cologne, who settled in Paris
    and became a naturalised Frenchman in 1647. He was an enthusiastic
    buyer of pictures, and his collection soon surpassed that of the
    French king. It was known to all French connoisseurs, and was visited
    by all travellers of note. In time, however, Jabach’s energies as a
    buyer exceeded his financial resources, and when his debts amounted to
    278,718 <i>livres</i> he offered his collection to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>, who
    was most anxious to distinguish his reign by the formation of a gallery
    of pictures which should be in all respects worthy of it. To this end
    he purchased Eberhard Jabach’s collection, paying 220,000 <i>livres</i>
    for the 5542 drawings and 101 pictures which it contained. The price
    originally asked by Jabach was 463,425 <i>livres</i>. Among the masterpieces
    thus acquired by the king were Titian’s <cite>Entombment</cite> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>(No. 1584,
    <a href="#i_plate13">Plate XIII.</a>), which Jabach had had the good fortune to purchase from
    the English royal collection for the absurdly small sum of £128, and
    Giorgione’s <cite>Pastoral Symphony</cite> (No. 1136, <a href="#i_plate10">Plate X.</a>), which had also
    been among the treasures of the English Crown.</p>

  <p>To Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642), who founded the French Academy in
    1635, at one time belonged Andrea Mantegna’s <cite>Parnassus</cite> (No. 1375,
    <a href="#i_plate14">Plate XIV.</a>), the same painter’s <cite>Wisdom victorious over the Vices</cite> (No.
    1376), Lorenzo Costa’s <cite>The Court of Isabella d’Este in the Garden of
    the Muses</cite> (No. 1261), and the same painter’s <cite>Mythological Scene</cite> (No.
    1262), together with Perugino’s <cite>Combat of Love and Chastity</cite> (No.
    1567).</p>

  <p>Another important buyer at the sale of Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>’s collection
    was Cardinal Mazarin (1602–61), who acquired several valuable pictures,
    besides statuary, tapestries, and other fabrics. Of Mazarin’s pictures
    the Louvre now possesses Raphael’s small <cite>St. Michael</cite> (No. 1502) and
    a <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1135), which is catalogued under the name of
    Giorgione, but it is more probably from the hand of Cariani.</p>

  <p>It is said that Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> preferred the pictures of his own
    court-painter, Charles Le Brun, to those of the Venetian master, Paolo
    Veronese, whose large canvas, <cite>The Supper at Emmaus</cite> (No. 1196), was
    nevertheless acquired during his reign. Eight pictures by Annibale
    Carracci, all of which are not now publicly exhibited in the Louvre
    (Nos. 1218, 1220, 1222, 1226, 1231–34), Albani’s <cite>Diana and Actæon</cite>
    (No. 1111), nine compositions by Guido Reni (Nos. 1439–55 and 1457),
    and ten paintings by Domenichino (Nos. 1609–10 and 1612–19), also
    enriched the royal collection during Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>’s reign.
    Nor were the great French painters neglected. The four pictures
    (Nos. 736–39) of <cite>The Seasons</cite>, by Nicolas Poussin, which had been
    commissioned in 1660 by the Duc de Richelieu for the decoration of
    the Château de Meudon, together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> with four of the largest Claudes
    now in the Louvre (Nos. 312, 314, 316, 317), were obtained for the
    royal galleries by the ever-watchful Colbert (1619–83), who had been
    appointed Minister of Finance on the death of Mazarin (1602–61).
    Flemish art, as seen in the stately pictures of Van Dyck, was
    represented by seven examples (Nos. 1961–63, 1970, 1973–75). On the
    other hand, Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> is said to have failed altogether to
    appreciate the work of Teniers and to have exclaimed, when some of
    that artist’s pictures were brought to his notice, “<i lang="fr">Ôtez-moi ces
    magots-là!</i>” Only one of the thirty-nine pictures by Teniers now in the
    Louvre, the <cite>Interior of a Cottage</cite> (No. 2162), passed into the Gallery
    at that date. The almost entire absence of Dutch pictures is also to be
    noticed.</p>

  <p>An event of extreme importance in this pompous reign was the
    institution of the French Academy of Arts, in 1648, with Charles Le
    Brun (1619–90) as Director, the despotic power which he exercised in
    art matters bringing about his further appointment as Director of the
    Gobelins tapestry works in 1660.</p>

  <p>In 1681 the Crown pictures and other royal art treasures were brought
    to the Louvre from Versailles and were temporarily exhibited there,
    the king paying a state visit to the capital on December 5 to see his
    <i lang="fr">cabinet de tableaux</i>. We read that the walls of eleven rooms were
    covered up to the cornices. The collection, putting on one side all
    doubts as to strict authenticity, included six paintings by Correggio,
    ten by Leonardo da Vinci, eight by Giorgione, twenty-three by Titian,
    nineteen by A. Carracci, twelve by Guido Reno, and eighteen by Paolo
    Veronese. These treasures, however, did not remain long at the Louvre,
    but were “packed up, loaded on rough carts, and taken back over the
    paved roads to Versailles,” which had now taken precedence over
    Fontainebleau as a royal residence; and at Versailles the Court mainly
    resided until the Revolution, although Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></span> greatly
    enlarged the Louvre Palace and planted the Tuileries Gardens. At the
    death of <i lang="fr">le Roi Soleil</i> the Crown pictures numbered 1500.</p>

  <p>The energy of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> was followed by the apathy of his
    degenerate successor, Louis <span class="smcap">xv.</span> (reigned 1715–74), who,
    however, added 300 pictures to the royal collection. The <cite>Virgin
    with the Blue Diadem</cite> or <cite>Virgin with the Veil</cite> (No. 1497), which
    still passes under the name of Raphael, was among the pictures
    which then passed out of the collection of the Prince de Carignan
    into the possession of the Crown. It was now a sorry moment for the
    pictures which, “scattered through the interminable and then ill-kept
    country palaces of the French Crown, exposed to every injury of time,
    ignorance, and weather, regarded at best in the light of old furniture
    and too often in that of old lumber, pleaded in vain for respect and
    care. No public Catalogue told of their existence; the generation that
    had talked of them had passed away; it was nobody’s business to ask for
    them, and few actually knew where they were. Even the new-comers passed
    into the same void which had swallowed their predecessors.” Some of
    the pictures previously recorded now disappeared completely, without
    leaving a clue to their fate. Eventually, in 1746, M. de la Fonte de
    Saint-Yenne in a pamphlet directed public opinion to the fact that
    these Crown pictures had for fifty years been hidden and neglected in
    “<i lang="fr">une obscure prison de Versailles</i>.” As a result of this, in 1750, by
    the king’s permission, 110 pictures selected from the different schools
    of painting were brought from Versailles to the Palais de Luxembourg,
    where the large canvases by Rubens (now in the Salle Rubens at the
    Louvre) were regarded as forming a <i lang="fr">centre d’études</i>. Here for the
    first time, and for two days only in the week, they were shown under
    certain restrictions to a limited public. In 1785 they were again
    removed to Versailles.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>Although Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>’s well-known grudge against Holland
    probably accounted for the almost entire absence of Dutch pictures
    from the Crown possessions, Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> had the good taste
    to acquire works by Aelbert Cuyp (No. 2341, <cite>Landscape</cite>); Jan van
    Goyen (No. 2375, <cite>Banks of a Dutch River</cite>, and No. 2377, <cite>A River
    in Holland</cite>); B. van der Helst (No. 2394, <cite>The Officers of the
    Arquebusiers of St. Sebastian</cite>); G. Metsu (No. 2461, <cite>The Alchemist</cite>);
    Adriaen van Ostade (No. 2495, <cite>The Painter’s Family</cite>[?], and No. 2496,
    <cite>The Schoolmaster</cite>); Isaac van Ostade (No. 2510, <cite>A Frozen Canal in
    Holland</cite>); Rembrandt (No. 2539, <cite>The Pilgrims at Emmaus</cite>, No. 2540,
    and No. 2541, <cite>The Philosopher in Meditation</cite>, No. 2555, <cite>Portrait of
    Rembrandt aged</cite>); Jacob van Ruisdael (No. 2559, <cite>Landscape</cite>, and No.
    2560, <cite>Sunny Landscape</cite>); Terborgh (No. 2587, <cite>The Military Gallant</cite>);
    and Philips Wouverman (No. 2621, <cite>The Prize Ox</cite>, and No. 2625, <cite>The
    Stag Hunt</cite>). Five of the less important of Murillo’s pictures now in
    the Louvre (Nos. 1712–15 and No. 1717) were also acquired at this
    period, and the series of twenty-two large canvases illustrating
    <cite>Scenes from the Life of St. Bruno</cite> by Eustache Le Sueur were also
    purchased by Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span></p>

  <p>From 1725 onwards the Salon held its Exhibitions in the Salon Carré
    (Room IV.), but after 1848 this room was used only for Paintings by the
    Old Masters.</p>

  <p>In 1790 a Commission was appointed by the National Assembly “to
    register and watch over all that was most valuable,” and on May
    26, 1791 a decree was made that the Louvre should be thenceforward
    dedicated to the conservation of objects of science and of art. On
    August 26 of the same year a further Commission was appointed by the
    National Convention to inspect and gather together the treasures of
    art scattered through <i lang="fr">les maisons royales</i>. The Convention decided
    that the “Museum of the Republic” should be officially opened in the
    Long Gallery of the Louvre on August 10, 1793, and from November 8 of
    the same year the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> Museum was open to the inspection of the public
    three days in every ten. This, the first public exhibition of art
    treasures in the Louvre, was the foundation of the present institution.
    The Catalogue of this date contains reference to only 537 pictures,
    the greater number of which came from Paris churches and national
    buildings. The inhabitants of Versailles now petitioned that their town
    should not be despoiled of its pictures, “and so be deprived of its
    last attraction in the eyes of the world”!</p>

  <p>The Louvre was now destined to become for a few years the temple of the
    <i>spolia opima</i> which the victorious French army brought home. “This
    system of levying pictures, statues, and other objects by means of
    treaties, so called, in which the conqueror dictated terms to those
    incapable of refusing them, was a dishonourable novelty in the annals
    of modern warfare. Disdaining the usages of Christian nations and
    overleaping especially the traditions of French courtesy and chivalry,
    Buonaparte turned back to the ages of pagan history for a precedent for
    his measures of spoliation.” By the Treaty of Bologna of June 23, 1796,
    and the Treaty of Tolentino of February 19, 1797, he became possessed
    of twenty pictures from Modena, twenty from Parma, forty from Bologna,
    ten from Ferrara, while Rome, Piacenza, Cento, Ravenna, Rimini, Pesaro,
    Ancona, Loreto, and Perugia also had to yield up a portion of their
    treasures.</p>

  <p>The first exhibition of this booty was held in the Louvre in January
    1798. Here, during the next few years, were gathered together many of
    the world’s most famous pictures, including Raphael’s <cite>St. Cecilia</cite>,
    now in the Bologna Gallery; Correggio’s <cite>St. Jerome</cite> and his <cite>Madonna
    della Scodella</cite>, now in the Parma Gallery; Raphael’s <cite>Transfiguration</cite>,
    now in the Vatican, and his <cite>Madonna della Sedia</cite>, now in the Pitti
    Palace at Florence; Domenichino’s <cite>Last Communion of St. Jerome</cite>, now
    in the Vatican; Titian’s <cite>Martyrdom of St. Peter Martyr</cite>, destroyed
    by fire in 1867,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> and his <cite>Assumption</cite>, now in the Venice Gallery;
    Van Eyck’s <cite>Adoration of the Lamb</cite>, now dismembered and distributed
    between Ghent, Berlin, and Brussels; Paris Bordone’s <cite>Fisherman of St.
    Mark</cite>, now in the Venice Gallery; and Paul Potter’s <cite>Bull</cite>, now at The
    Hague. “Here was seen the unexampled sight of twenty-five Raphaels
    ranked together, the great master complete in every period and walk of
    his art. Here twenty-three Titians glowed in burning row. Here Rubens
    revelled in no less than fifty-three pictures and in almost as many
    classes of subject. Van Dyck followed his illustrious master with
    thirty-three works, while thirty-one specimens of Rembrandt’s brush
    shed a golden atmosphere upon the walls. The later Italians especially
    were magnificently represented—thirty-six pictures by Annibale
    Carracci, sixteen by Domenichino; twenty-three by Guido; including the
    largest altarpieces by each; and twenty-six by Guercino, were perhaps
    the most popular part of the wondrous show.”</p>

  <p>However, in September 1815, the pictures and other valuable works of
    art which France had plundered from her foes had to be given back, and
    the spoliation of the Louvre began. In all, 5233 objects, of which 2065
    were pictures, were taken away from the Royal Museum by the Allied
    Powers.</p>

  <p>An event rare in the history of public galleries took place in 1813,
    when the Louvre received Carpaccio’s <cite>Preaching of St. Stephen</cite> (No.
    1211), Boltraffio’s <cite>Madonna of the Casio Family</cite> (No. 1169), Marco
    d’Oggiono’s <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1382), Moretto’s <cite>St. Bernardino of
    Siena and St. Louis of Toulouse</cite> (No. 1175), and the same artist’s <cite>St.
    Bonaventura and St. Anthony of Padua</cite> (No. 1176), in exchange for five
    pictures by Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and Jordaens.</p>

  <p>It is curious to notice that at this period very little importance
    was attached to Italian primitives, which were, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> deemed
    “barbarous.” Many beautiful works of the very early Italian schools
    were actually not considered worth the trouble and expense of
    transport, and were therefore left for the lasting glory of the
    Louvre. Among them may be mentioned Fra Angelico’s <cite>Coronation of
    the Virgin</cite> (No. 1290); the <cite>Madonna and Child and Two Saints</cite>, (No.
    1114), now officially ascribed to Albertinelli; Bronzino’s <cite>Christ and
    the Magdalene</cite> (No. 1183); the <cite>Madonna and Angels</cite> (No. 1260), which
    passes under the name of Cimabue; Gentile da Fabriano’s <cite>Presentation
    in the Temple</cite> (No. 1278); the <cite>Coronation of the Virgin</cite> (No. 1303),
    still officially ascribed to Raffaellino del Garbo; <cite>St. Francis of
    Assisi receiving the Stigmata</cite> (No. 1312), which still passes under the
    name of Giotto; Benozzo Gozzoli’s <cite>Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas</cite> (No.
    1319); Fra Filippo Lippi’s <cite>Madonna and Child between Two Saints</cite> (No.
    1344); Pesellino’s two small predella pictures (No. 1414); Piero di
    Cosimo’s <cite>Coronation of the Virgin</cite> (No. 1416); <cite>The Madonna in Glory
    between St. Bernard and St. Mary Magdalene</cite> (No. 1482), which is still
    assigned to Cosimo Rosselli; Lorenzo di Credi’s <cite>Madonna and Child with
    St. Julian and St. Nicholas</cite> (No. 1263); Cima’s <cite>Madonna and Child</cite>
    (No. 1259); Vasari’s <cite>Annunciation</cite> (No. 1575), which is now in one of
    the storerooms of the Louvre; the Ferrarese <cite>Madonna and Child with
    St. Quentin and St. Benedict</cite> (No. 1167), which is still assigned to
    Bianchi; Andrea Mantegna’s <cite>Calvary</cite> (No. 1373) and <cite>Virgin of Victory</cite>
    (No. 1374); Domenico Ghirlandaio’s <cite>Visitation</cite> (No. 1321); and
    Perugino’s <cite>St. Paul</cite> (No. 1566). Further proof of the slight regard
    in which certain pictures that we cherish to-day were then held is
    afforded by the readiness with which the authorities sent two panels of
    Mantegna’s altarpiece, the centre-part of which is now in the Church of
    San Zeno at Verona, to the Museum at Tours, and parted with Perugino’s
    altarpieces to the public galleries of Lyons and Marseilles.</p>

  <p>Under Louis <span class="smcap">xviii</span>. (died 1824) 111 pictures were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> purchased
    for the national collection at a cost of £26,730, but during the
    reign of Charles <span class="smcap">x.</span> (1824–30) only 30 were acquired, £2511
    being expended on them. An outlay of £2965 by Louis Philippe (reigned
    1830–48) enriched the Louvre with 33 more pictures, but that king
    concentrated his efforts on the restoration and decoration of the
    Château of Versailles, on which he spent £440,000.</p>

  <p>In the early years of the Second Republic a large number of
    improvements were effected in the Louvre, and in 1848 £8000 was spent
    on restoring several of the rooms now hung with pictures, which were
    first systematically arranged three years later. Although the Museum
    had at that period an annual grant of £2000 for the purchase of
    pictures, special grants in aid were made from time to time, notably
    on the occasion of the sale of Marshal Soult, pictures from whose
    collection were acquired in 1852 for £24,612. In this way Murillo’s
    <cite>Immaculate Conception</cite> (No. 1709, <a href="#i_plate26">Plate XXVI.</a>) passed to the Louvre
    from the “Plunder-master-General” of the Spanish campaign.</p>

  <p>During the Second Empire the Musée du Louvre acquired about 200 Italian
    primitives from the Campana collection, while seven years later it
    was further enriched by the important bequest by Dr. La Caze of 275
    paintings of different schools. Since 1870, when the Palace of the
    Tuileries was destroyed, the permanent collection has been increased
    by the purchase in 1883 for £8000 of the Morris Moore “Raphael” (No.
    1509), which has since come to be universally regarded as a work by
    Perugino; while about 300 other paintings of varying importance have
    also been acquired from time to time with Government funds. In recent
    years the national collection has benefited largely by the generosity
    of private donors, among whom we may mention MM. Duchâtel, Gatteaux,
    His de la Salle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> Lallemant, Maciet, Rodolphe Kann, Sedelmeyer,
    Grandidier, Vandeul, and several members of the Rothschild family.</p>

  <p>In 1896, by the sale of a large proportion of the Crown jewels, a
    <i lang="fr">Caisse des Musées</i> was organised, and the annual income devoted to
    the purchase of pictures notably increased. A year later the <cite>Société
    des Amis du Louvre</cite>, which corresponds to the National Art-Collections
    Fund in England, was founded to assist in securing pictures and other
    works of art for the nation; by that means the <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No.
    1300<span class="smcap">a</span> or 1300<span class="smcap">b</span>) which passes under the name of Piero
    dei Franceschi was acquired by the Louvre.</p>

  <p>In May 1900, on the inauguration of the <cite>Exposition Universelle</cite>, the
    opportunity was taken to rehang a large part of the collection, and
    the Galerie de Médicis (Room XVIII.) and the eighteen small cabinets
    built round it were first used for the better exhibition of a large
    proportion of the Flemish and Dutch pictures. Shortly afterwards,
    by the death of M. Thomy Thiéry, an Englishman who had become a
    naturalised Frenchman, over 100 paintings, mostly of the school of
    Barbizon, became an exceedingly valuable addition to the Louvre, and
    filled a void in the history of French painting in the nineteenth
    century. During the last two years the most memorable purchases by
    the Government have been that of Chardin’s <cite>Child with a Top</cite> (No.
    90<span class="smcap">a</span>), which was acquired together with the same artist’s
    <cite>Young Man with a Violin</cite> (No. 90<span class="smcap">b</span>) for £14,000, and Hans
    Memlinc’s <cite>Portrait of an Old Lady</cite> (<a href="#i_plate17">Plate XVII.</a>) for £8000.</p>

  <p>The national collection of the Musée du Louvre now includes in its
    Catalogue nearly two thousand eight hundred oil and tempera paintings,
    about four hundred of which have not been exhibited for many years. </p>

    <h2 id="EARLY_SIENESE_SCHOOL">EARLY SIENESE SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS school of painting, one of the earliest in the history of art in
    Italy and probably the earliest with which the ordinary student of
    art in Italy will concern himself, was affected throughout the whole
    range of its history by the influence of the miniaturists. It was
    characterised by naïveté, and in the hands of its earliest painter,
    Duccio di Buoninsegna (1255–1319), strove to realise an effect of
    hieratic sumptuousness, its precision and grace being that of “a
    sanctuary swept and garnished.”</p>

  <p>The Louvre possesses no picture by Duccio, who derived his technique
    from the Byzantine miniaturists, although he modified their methods.
    Standing between the old world and the new, Duccio occupied an
    important position at the head of the school of Siena, which in the
    early years of the fourteenth century set a noble example to the other
    towns and incipient schools of Tuscany. Passing reference may here be
    made to the artistic aims and religious aspirations of the cities of
    Rome, Pisa, and Arezzo, but it is Siena which stands out pre-eminently
    at this early date as interpreting scenes of quiet rapture and sacred
    peace, its own social life being bound up in “chivalry, the meat of
    the eye,” and “piety, the wine of the soul.” Both Duccio, who was
    first employed by the Government of his native city as early as 1278,
    and Cimabue, his senior by fifteen years (if we are to accept the
    much contested records), have alike been hailed as the author of the
    <cite>Rucellai Madonna</cite> which still hangs in the Church of S. Maria Novella
    in Florence. This picture was a generation ago almost unanimously
    accepted by responsible critics as the work of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> Florentine painter,
    and those who still advocate the claims of “Florentinism” are loath to
    destroy their cherished illusions. It is not our duty here to bring
    forward the arguments in favour of its later ascription to Duccio, who,
    we are led to believe, painted it early in his career, before he had
    learnt to free himself from the stiff gestures and Byzantine types of
    a former tradition. Duccio, it must be conceded, never quite succeeded
    in giving to his compositions that sense of life, character, and design
    which we find in the works of Giotto, his junior by some twenty years,
    who was the first artist to accomplish vast schemes of monumental
    decoration. Duccio, however, was the bearer of that torch which was
    to kindle the flame of religious art both in Siena and Florence.
    Nevertheless, Sienese painting was destined, almost from the moment of
    its birth, to show signs of dwindling into a school of trite copyists
    and shallow quietists. Early in the fourteenth century the lofty ideals
    manifested by emotional Siena spread to scientific Florence, and by
    the beginning of the fifteenth century the city on the Arno gave
    unmistakable signs of becoming the leading art centre in Tuscany.</p>

  <h3 id="DUCCIOS_FOLLOWERS">DUCCIO’S FOLLOWERS</h3>

  <p>The greatest of Duccio’s followers was Simone Martini (1285?–1344), who
    was also slightly influenced by Giotto. Simone, whose <cite>Christ bearing
    His Cross</cite> (No. 1383, <a href="#i_plate01">Plate I.</a>) is the earliest Sienese picture in the
    Louvre, has been well described as “a reactionary who made a whole
    beautiful world of his own.” In this small picture the colours stand
    out most clearly, although the drawing and perspective are, of course,
    faulty. It belongs to a series of which other panels are at Antwerp
    and in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. A <cite>Crucifixion</cite> (No.
    1665) that is catalogued as being by an unknown Sienese artist may be
    attributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> to Ugolino da Siena (fl. 1290–1320); it would seem to be
    the centre panel of a large and lost altarpiece.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Pietro Lorenzetti (fl. 1305–50) was probably a pupil of Duccio, and
    was influenced by Simone Martini, but Pietro and his younger brother,
    Ambrogio Lorenzetti (1285?–1348?), who represented a new movement and
    endeavoured to set forth the civic ideal, are not represented in this
    collection.</p>

  <p>Simone Martini’s brother-in-law, Lippo Memmi (died 1357?), is possibly
    the author of the <cite>St. Peter</cite> (No. 1152), a poor picture which is
    officially assigned to Taddeo di Bartolo (1362?–1422). The art of
    the latter is, in the opinion of Mr. Berenson, seen in the small
    <cite>Crucifixion</cite> (No. 1622), which the Louvre authorities modestly
    catalogue as being by an unknown fourteenth-century Italian painter.</p>

  <p>To Bartolo di Maestro Fredi (1330?–1410), who came under the influence
    of Lippo Memmi and the Lorenzetti, is given a <cite>Presentation in the
    Temple</cite> (No. 1151). Paolo di Giovanni Fei (fl. 1372–1410), whose
    pictures are rarely met with out of Italy, may be regarded as the
    author of the <cite>Madonna and Saints</cite> (No. 1314) which is officially held
    to be by an unknown Florentine painter of the school of Giotto. The
    Louvre possesses no example of the art of Sassetta (1392–1450), who,
    together with Paolo di Giovanni Fei, deeply impressed Giovanni di
    Paolo (1403?–1482). The latter may be credited with the small panel
    (No. 1659<span class="smcap">a</span>) which is officially entitled <cite>The Entry of Pope
    Martin into the Castle of Saint Angelo</cite>, and included in the Catalogue
    as being by an unknown Florentine, but labelled “School of Masaccio.”
    There can be no doubt that this quaint little picture depicts <cite>Pope
    Gregory the Great’s Vision of the Archangel Michael sheathing his Sword
    over the Castle of Saint Angelo</cite>. According to the legend, Gregory
    had been indefatigable in nursing the plague-stricken in Rome in the
    sixth century, and while on his way at the head of a procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> to
    offer up prayer for the cessation of the plague, saw “the warrior of
    God” in the attitude here shown. Gregory, after fleeing from those who
    wished to make him Pope, was elected to wear the papal tiara under
    the title of Gregory the Great. He is chiefly known to us as having
    sent missionaries to preach the gospel in England, having been moved
    to pity by seeing British captives exposed for sale in Rome, and for
    his arrangement of the music of the chants which are after him known
    as Gregorians. The official title of the picture, on the other hand,
    assumes that we have here Pope Martin <span class="smcap">v</span>., a man of saintly character,
    making his entry into Rome in 1421 amid the acclamations of the
    people. He had been elected Pope in 1417 on the deposition of John
    <span class="smcap">xxiii.</span></p>

  <p>By this time the art of Siena had progressed some distance on the
    road that its religious aspirations and technical accomplishments
    indicated, but it soon became evident that the more intellectual aims
    of Florentine art were shaping the course of all the painters of Italy.</p>

    <h2 id="THE_FLORENTINE_SCHOOL">THE FLORENTINE SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH we have begun our study of the art of Italy with a review of
    the Sienese School, which owes its importance to Duccio, the earliest
    Italian picture in the Louvre is the <cite>Madonna and Angels</cite> (No. 1260),
    which may be accepted as a characteristic example of the type of
    picture that passes under the name of Cimabue (1240?–1302).</p>

  <p>Giovanni Cenni de’ Pepi, to give him his full name, has been hailed
    as “the father of modern painting.” The Louvre <cite>Madonna</cite>, which was
    formerly in the Church of San Francesco at Pisa, was carried off to
    Paris by Napoleon, but not considered worth the trouble of repacking
    when in 1815 the Allied Armies called upon the French to surrender
    the pictorial spoils of war. It is known that Cimabue was working at
    Pisa at the very end of his life, and, although he was engaged there
    as mosaicist rather than as a painter, the <i lang="fr">provenance</i> of this large
    painting, which is executed in tempera on panel, has to be taken
    into account in any discussion as to its strict authenticity. It is
    certainly reminiscent of the <cite>Rucellai Madonna</cite>, and shares much of
    its character. The painter has repeated, with certain modifications,
    the Byzantine type of Madonna, whose almond-shaped eyes and long, bony
    fingers should be noticed. It has been freely restored.</p>

  <p>From the same church in Pisa comes Giotto’s <cite>St. Francis of Assisi
    receiving the Stigmata</cite> (No. 1312). According to the descriptive
    account handed down to us by the unveracious Vasari, Giotto (1266–1337)
    was originally a shepherd boy whose latent talent was recognised by the
    discerning Cimabue, who forthwith took him as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> his pupil and taught
    him how to paint, the boy’s genius enabling him early to surpass his
    master. Although it would be rash unquestioningly to accept this
    archaic production as an authentic work by Giotto, it is one which any
    national collection would treasure. It depicts the supreme event in
    the life of St. Francis, when during his vision virtue passed from the
    wounded hands, the wounded feet, and the wounded side of the Christ
    into the same parts of the saint’s body. In the predella are three
    scenes from the life of St. Francis: (<i>a</i>) <cite>Pope Innocent III. dreaming
    that St. Peter reveals to him that unless the Franciscan Order is
    founded the Church</cite> (typified here by the Church of S. John Lateran in
    Rome) <em>will fall down</em>; (<i>b</i>) <cite>The Pope founding the Order</cite>; and (<i>c</i>)
    <cite>St. Francis, wearing the brown robes of his Order, and preaching to
    the birds</cite>: “Whenas St. Francis spake these words to them, those birds
    began all of them to open their beaks, and stretch their necks, and
    spread their wings, and reverently bend their heads down to the ground,
    and by their acts and by their songs to show that the Holy Father gave
    them joy exceeding great.”</p>

  <h3 id="THE_GIOTTESQUES">THE GIOTTESQUES</h3>

  <p>Four school pictures (Nos. 1313, 1315–1317) illustrate the example set
    by Giotto, who influenced very strongly indeed all art-manifestation
    during the fourteenth century, an age when the human body was denied
    all intrinsic significance. His profound feeling, gay colour, high
    dramatic power, and sense of form mark the emancipation of Italian
    art from the rigid formalism of the Byzantine manner. He discovered
    a style which was admirably suited to the spirit of his time, and
    developed for his own purposes a sense of perspective which he employed
    with considerable effect, although he never really found a scientific
    statement of the artistic principles which he instinctively perceived.
    His indefatigable energy and innate genius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> enabled him to distance his
    rivals and to bequeath to his countrymen a heritage which profoundly
    affected the art of Italy.</p>

  <p>Foremost among his followers, who imitated his mannerisms without
    understanding the full significance of his ideas, was Taddeo Gaddi
    (1300?–1366), to whom are assigned in the official Catalogue the
    predella pictures (No. 1302) of (<i>a</i>) <cite>The Death of St. John the
    Baptist</cite>, (<i>b</i>) <cite>Calvary</cite>, and (<i>c</i>) <cite>Judas Iscariot</cite>. Taddeo Gaddi, a
    painter and architect, was the godson and pupil of Giotto as well as
    the pupil of his father, Gaddo Gaddi. Taddeo’s desire to give suitable
    expression to each of his figures often resulted, as in that of the
    daughter of Herodias in the second of these panels, in exaggeration.</p>

  <p>Taddeo’s son, Agnolo Gaddi (1333–1396), who was described by Ruskin as
    “rather stupid in religious matters and high art,” may be the painter
    of the <cite>Annunciation</cite> (No. 1301), in which we see the Virgin seated in
    a loggia to the right of the picture. The Archangel Gabriel announces,
    by the gesture of the right hand, that the Virgin shall be the Mother
    of the Christ. God the Father is shown in the heavens. Notice the
    gold background and the mosaics of the loggia. The mechanical methods
    and uninspired aims of the Giottesques, the artists who worked during
    the century which followed the death of Giotto, are well seen in the
    productions of Lorenzo di Bicci (fl. 1370–1409), his son Bicci di
    Lorenzo (fl. 1373–1424), and his grandson Neri di Bicci (1419–1491).
    Neri is represented by a <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1397). He might
    justly be described as a mere manufacturer of Giottesque pictures to
    order. He brought art down to the level of a trade, his work being flat
    and his colour raw and inharmonious.</p>

  <p>A <cite>Virgin and Infant Christ</cite> (No. 1563), inscribed “<span class="smcap">tvrinvs
    vannis de pisis me piqsit p</span>,” is evidently by Turino Vanni (fl.
    1390–1398), a rare artist of this group of Florentine painters. The
    brief list of his pictures might be increased by having added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> to it
    a few panels at Pisa and Assisi, which are erroneously ascribed to
    Buffalmacco.</p>

  <p>Andrea Orcagna (1308?–1368?) and his brother Nardo are not represented
    in the Louvre, but we have a follower of Agnolo Gaddi in Lorenzo
    Monaco (1370?–1425), who is seen to advantage in his <cite>Christ in the
    Garden of Gethsemane</cite> and his <cite>Holy Women preparing the Tomb</cite> (No.
    1348<span class="smcap">a</span>), which is inscribed “<span class="smcap">anno dñi</span> 1408,” and
    was formerly attributed to Gentile da Fabriano. Lorenzo Monaco is
    officially credited with a triple picture (No. 1348) of (<i>a</i>) <cite>St.
    Agnes</cite> with her lamb and a martyr’s palm branch; (<i>b</i>) <cite>St. Lawrence</cite>,
    the artist’s name-saint, holding in his right hand a book and palm
    branch, and enthroned on a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom; and
    (<i>c</i>) <cite>St. Margaret</cite>, the patron saint of Woman as Mother, standing on
    the dragon. Lorenzo Monaco, who is reputed to have been the master of
    Fra Angelico, usually depicts long, slender, and sinuous bodies. Below
    this picture hangs a small panel, apparently part of the predella of
    an unidentified altarpiece. It does not seem to be included in the
    official Catalogue, and has neither a number by which to identify
    it nor a label to denote its subject or authorship! The picture has
    apparently never been referred to or described in any article or book.
    It certainly represents the Emperor Heraclius carrying the True Cross
    into Jerusalem. The picture appears to have been painted by Giovanni
    del Ponte (fl. 1385–1437).</p>

  <p>Neither Starnina (1354–1408), who took the traditions of Early
    Florentine painting to Spain, Masolino (fl. 1383–1435), who is rarely
    met with out of Italy, nor Masaccio (1401–28), who may be said to
    have vitalised Italian art, is represented in the Louvre. Tommaso
    Masaccio, the “Hulking Tom” of Browning, gave to Italy and the world
    the magnificent series of frescoes which still decorate the Brancacci
    Chapel of the Carmine Church in Florence. He imparted to his figures
    such natural movement, vivacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> of expression, free attitudes, simple
    draperies, and excellent modelling that he entirely revolutionised the
    art of Florence. His figures are, as Vasari said, “so lifelike that
    they seem to live and breathe.” This series of frescoes was studied
    with enthusiasm by all the great Florentine painters; Leonardo,
    Raphael, Michelangelo, and innumerable other artists derived the
    greatest possible benefit from them.</p>

  <h3 id="FRA_ANGELICO">FRA ANGELICO</h3>

  <p>On the threshold of the Renaissance stands Fra Angelico (1387–1455),
    who was trained in the school of miniaturists and influenced by Lorenzo
    Monaco and Masaccio. His life was devoted to “the service of God, the
    benefit of the world, and his duty towards his neighbour,” as Vasari
    says. He regarded painting as one of the duties of the monastic life,
    and never began to paint without first kneeling in prayer. His pictures
    are aspirations towards heaven, while the figures with which he peoples
    his saintly compositions have faces which show peace, joy, hope,
    and communion with God. They are clothed in draperies of the purest
    colours, crowned with glories of burnished gold, but are never dramatic
    in their action. One of his best easel paintings outside Florence,
    where alone his art can be adequately studied, is his early <cite>Coronation
    of the Virgin</cite> (No. 1290). This imposing, if overcrowded, composition
    is painted to the glory of God and in honour of the Dominican Order, to
    which the painter belonged. In the right bottom corner we see St. Agnes
    with her lamb, next to her St. Catherine with her wheel, above is St.
    Lawrence with his gridiron, and to the latter’s right St. Peter Martyr
    in Dominican robes and with wounded head. In the foreground kneels
    St. Mary Magdalene in red, her box of ointment in her left hand. St.
    Nicholas with the three golden balls at his feet, St. Thomas Aquinas
    in Dominican robes and holding the theological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> book from which rays
    of golden light issue, St. Louis (Louis <span class="smcap">ix.</span>, King of France),
    and St. Dominic himself—all help to swell the heavenly company. In the
    predella, or lower part, of this panel picture are depicted <cite>Scenes
    from the Life of St. Dominic</cite>, the founder of Fra Angelico’s own Order:
    (<i>a</i>) Pope Innocent <span class="smcap">iii.</span> in his vision sees St. Dominic
    supporting the falling Church; (<i>b</i>) the Pope receives, through the
    agency of St. Peter and St. Paul who hand him a staff and the Gospel,
    Divine authority to found the Dominican Order; (<i>c</i>) the Saint brings
    back to life a young noble named Napoleon who had been trampled under
    foot by a horse; (<i>d</i>) Christ in the tomb, the Virgin and St. John;
    (<i>e</i>) St. Dominic challenges heretics whose books are consumed in the
    fire, while his own book of the true Gospel issues forth unhurt by the
    action of fire; (<i>f</i>) angels descend from heaven to feed the starving
    monastery of St. Sabina at Rome immediately after St. Dominic has asked
    a blessing; these two blue-clad figures are among the loveliest of all
    Fra Angelico’s angelic beings, and perhaps the most inspiring figures
    in the whole of the Louvre collection; (<i>g</i>) the death of the Saint at
    Bologna and the passing of his soul up to heaven in accordance with the
    vision of the monk at Brescia. This early Cinquecento panel picture,
    which was formerly in the Church of S. Domenico at Fiesole, near
    Florence, was painted before the Beato went to beautify the cells of S.
    Marco with frescoes. It is one of the best of the primitive pictures in
    the Louvre.</p>

  <p>From the hand of the same saintly painter are the <cite>Adoring Angel</cite> (no
    No.), which until 1909 was in the Victor Gay collection, the <cite>Martyrdom
    of St. Cosmo and St. Damian</cite> (No. 1293), part of the predella of
    a dismembered altarpiece, and the large fresco painting of the
    <cite>Crucifixion</cite> (No. 1294) which hangs on the Escalier Daru. The latter
    was purchased, together with Domenico Ghirlandaio’s <cite>Bottle-nosed Man</cite>
    (No. 1322, <a href="#i_plate03">Plate III.</a>), in 1879 for £1960.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> The <cite>Beheading of St. John
    the Baptist</cite> (No. 1291) and the <cite>Resurrection</cite> (No. 1294<span class="smcap">a</span>) are
    unauthentic.</p>

  <p>In Benozzo Gozzoli (1420–1498) we have an assistant and follower
    of Fra Angelico. He worked at different towns in Italy, notably at
    Montefalco, Orvieto, Florence, San Gimignano, Rome, and Pisa, where
    he died. Although his earlier work reminds us of Fra Angelico, than
    whom he is much more dramatic and much less spiritual, in later life
    he depicts the costumes and life of his time in a more realistic and
    objective manner. His <cite>Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas</cite> (No. 1319),
    which originally hung in the Cathedral at Pisa, deals with a subject
    often met with in the art of the period. The great Dominican teacher,
    whom the heathen philosophers, Aristotle on the left, and Plato on
    the right, recognise as their master in philosophy, is enthroned, his
    books of theological learning on his knees. At his feet, subdued, is
    Guillaume de St. Amour, the author of a book entitled <cite>De Periculis
    Novissimorum Temporum</cite>, in which he exposed the various abuses then
    prevalent among the mendicants. The dramatic action seen in the lower
    part of the panel embraces Pope Alexander <span class="smcap">iv.</span> presiding over
    the religious council of Agnani, and the envoys of St. Louis (Louis
    <span class="smcap">ix.</span> of France) who took steps to end the religious conflicts
    of 1256. A large altarpiece (No. 1320) representing the <cite>Madonna and
    Child Enthroned</cite>, <cite>St. Cosmo</cite>, <cite>St. Damian</cite>, <cite>St. Jerome</cite>, <cite>St. John
    the Baptist</cite>, <cite>St. Francis d’Assisi</cite>, and <cite>St. Lawrence</cite> in the central
    panel is also assigned to Benozzo. The frame also contains seven
    predella pictures, and at either end is the coat of arms of the Medici
    family.</p>

  <p>The great French Museum, which is weaker than the National Gallery,
    the Berlin Gallery, and certain other national collections in Italian
    primitives, affords us no example of the art of Andrea del Castagno
    (fl. 1410–1457), whose compositions are characterised by harsh colour,
    hard lines, and crude forms. Nor do we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> here any painting by that
    very rare artist, Domenico Veneziano (1400?–1461), who, it has been
    said, was the first Tuscan artist to work in an oil medium.</p>

  <h3 id="PAOLO_UCCELLO">PAOLO UCCELLO</h3>

  <p>Prominent among the masters who were influenced by Donatello, the
    sculptor, and Lorenzo Ghiberti, the first metal-worker in elegant
    forms, is Paolo di Dono, generally known as Uccello. His profound study
    and ultimate discovery of the laws of linear perspective was enhanced
    by the inquiries into the laws of aerial perspective that Fra Angelico
    studied so deeply. Paolo Uccello (1397–1475) was a pupil and assistant
    of Lorenzo Ghiberti, who made the bronze doors for the East Side of
    the Baptistery at Florence. He gave himself up to the scientific study
    of perspective, the principles of which he was one of the first to
    apply to painting, thus rendering incalculable services to art. In his
    <cite>Battlepiece</cite> (No. 1273) is seen a mounted soldier in armour with his
    sword drawn; on the left are horsemen about to charge with couchant
    lances, while on the right cavalry-men are drawn up awaiting orders,
    their lances in rest. The correctness of the perspective and the
    justice of the foreshortenings and the movements of the foot-men in the
    intervals of the cavalry mark an epoch in art. This is the third and
    right-hand panel of the series of three battle-pictures which Uccello
    painted for the Casa Medici (now the Riccardi Palace) in Florence
    for Cosimo de’ Medici about the year 1457, and not, as the official
    Catalogue asserts, for the Bartolini family. The best preserved of
    these three large panel pictures illustrating the <cite>Rout of San Romano
    in 1432</cite> is that in the National Gallery (No. 583), while the second or
    centre panel of the series is now in the Uffizi (No. 52). The Louvre
    panel is in a deplorable condition, caused by long neglect.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>Uccello’s <cite>Portraits of Giotto, Paolo Uccello, Antonio Manetti, and
    Filippo Brunelleschi</cite> (No. 1272), whose names are in this order on the
    panel, is a work of considerable importance, as marking an early stage
    in the development of portraiture. This picture, which is referred
    to at some length by Vasari, constitutes a historical document. The
    Italian chronicler tells us that Uccello “was a person of eccentric
    character and peculiar habits, but he was a great lover of ability
    in those of his own art, and, to the end that their memory should
    remain to posterity, he drew with his own hand on an oblong picture
    the portraits of five distinguished men, which he kept in his house
    as a memorial of them. The first of these portraits was that of the
    painter Giotto, as one who had given light and new life to the art;
    the second was Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, for architecture; the third
    was Donatello, for sculpture; the fourth was himself, for perspective
    and animals; the fifth was his friend Giovanni (<i>sic</i>) Manetti, for
    mathematics. With this philosopher Paolo conferred very frequently, and
    held continual discourse with him concerning the problems of Euclid.”
    Manetti’s real Christian name, Antonio, is correctly inscribed on the
    panel, but is inaccurately given as Giovanni by Vasari and on the
    official label.</p>

  <p>The <cite>St. John the Baptist as a Child</cite> (No. 1274), which hangs in the
    Long Gallery, is labelled as a picture of the Florentine school, and
    catalogued as being by Uccello. It is perhaps by Piero di Cosimo.</p>

  <p>We enter on the first period of the coming Renaissance with Fra Filippo
    Lippi (1406–1469), who was trained in the best school of Florentine
    painting. He was a pupil of Lorenzo Monaco, came under the influence
    of Fra Angelico, and was affected by the magic spell of Masaccio, whom
    he must have seen at work in the Brancacci Chapel. In the latter half
    of the Quattrocento the cult of love and beauty was rapidly dethroning
    the more austere ideals of an earlier age. Filippo Lippi’s stormy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
    romantic career passes into a new phase with his residence at Prato
    in 1452. Four years later he was appointed Chaplain to the nuns of S.
    Margherita in that town. The year before his arrival in Prato, Lucrezia
    and Spinetta, the orphan daughters (aged eighteen and seventeen
    respectively) of Francesco Buti, had, apparently much against their
    will, been placed in the Convent, the abbess of which commissioned the
    Frate to paint a picture of the <cite>Madonna della Cintola</cite>. Lucrezia posed
    to the painter-chaplain for the figure of the Madonna in that picture.
    On May 1, 1456, on the occasion of the exhibition of the Holy Girdle of
    the Virgin, a precious relic still preserved at Prato, the painter bore
    off Lucrezia out of the safe keeping of the convent. A short summary of
    these well-known facts is suggested by the view which is put forward in
    the official Catalogue of the Louvre, to the effect that the <cite>Madonna
    della Cintola</cite> is to be identified with the <cite>Nativity</cite> (No. 1343)
    in this Gallery. The weight of evidence is against this theory; in
    fact, this large panel picture has little claim to be regarded as the
    work of Fra Filippo. One critic has given it as his opinion that the
    <cite>Nativity</cite> was begun by Fra Filippo and completed by Fra Diamante, who
    succeeded him as Chaplain at Prato. Others have attributed the picture
    to Pesellino, Baldovinetti, and Stefano da Zevio respectively. It seems
    to show the influence of Andrea del Castagno. The official Catalogue
    does not indicate the <i lang="fr">provenance</i> of the picture, although it implies
    that it came from the Convent at Prato at the time when it was brought
    to Paris by Napoleon. There can be little doubt that the <cite>Madonna della
    Cintola</cite> is the painting thus named which still hangs in the place of
    honour in the Municipal Gallery at Prato.</p>

  <p>The Louvre does, however, possess in the <cite>Madonna and Child with Angels
    and Two Abbots</cite> (No. 1344, <a href="#i_plate02">Plate II.</a>) one of the best of the Frate’s
    creations, although the colouring has suffered considerably. It is an
    early work, and was painted about 1437 for the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>Barbadori Chapel
    in Santo Spirito. It contains beauty of line, freshness of colour, and
    much variety in the composition. The cast of the draperies is ample and
    the motives are novel and bold, the Renaissance background throwing
    into prominent relief the soulful and ideal figure of the Madonna. The
    predella panels of this dismembered altarpiece, for which Fra Filippo
    received forty gold florins, are now in the Accademia at Florence. They
    depict (<i>a</i>) <cite>St. Frediano deviating the Course of the River Serchio</cite>;
    (<i>b</i>) <cite>The Virgin receiving the Announcement of her Coming Decease</cite>;
    and (<i>c</i>) <cite>St. Augustine in his Study</cite>. The <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No.
    1345) is only a school picture.</p>

  <p>In 1457, the year that Fra Filippo’s son Filippino was born, his
    household effects and box of colours were seized for debt. He lived on
    until October 4, 1469, when he died of a sudden and somewhat mysterious
    illness. The Frate, who is the connecting link between Masaccio, the
    first blossom, and Raphael, the full flower of Florentine painting, was
    the master of Botticelli. A small <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1345) has
    little claim to be regarded as the work of Fra Filippo.</p>

  <p>In our attempt to unravel the skein of Italian art in this collection
    and to sketch its history in strict chronological order we may now
    consider two small predella panels of (<i>a</i>) <cite>St. Francis receiving
    the Stigmata</cite> and (<i>b</i>) <cite>An Incident in the Life of St. Cosmo and St.
    Damian</cite> (No. 1414) by Francesco Pesellino (1422–1457). The former deals
    with a subject we have already met with in this Gallery (No. 1312); the
    latter is a new theme. St. Cosmo and St. Damian were wealthy men and
    spent their time in doing charitable works as doctors without monetary
    reward, and are thus sometimes known as “the Holy Money-despisers.”
    According to the legend here represented, a Christian was one day
    praying to these saints in the church dedicated to them in Rome in
    the fervent hope that he might be healed of cancer in the leg. While
    thus at prayer he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> imagined that his leg was amputated and replaced by
    that of a dead Moor. In this small panel the saints are shown in the
    act of placing the black man’s limb on the body of the Christian, who,
    no doubt, will before long be healed. St. Cosmo and St. Damian being
    patron saints of the Medici family are often met with in Florentine
    art. We have already in this collection looked at a picture (No. 1293)
    by Fra Angelico illustrating their martyrdom. Pesellino, who studied
    the art of Fra Angelico, Masaccio, and Domenico Veneziano, and followed
    somewhat closely in the steps of Fra Filippo Lippi, can hardly have
    painted the small three-panel picture officially ascribed to him of
    (<i>a</i>) <cite>The Dead Christ</cite>, (<i>b</i>) <cite>A Cardinal supporting the Bodies of Two
    Men who have been hanged</cite>, and (<i>c</i>) <cite>A Cardinal appearing in a Vision
    to a Bishop</cite>. This small work (No. 1415), which was formerly in the
    Campana collection, has been claimed by Dr. Venturi and Mr. Berenson to
    be by the Umbrian artist, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Madonna and Child and St. Augustin, St. John the Baptist, St.
    Anthony, and St. Francis</cite> (No. 1661), which is officially catalogued
    as being by an Unknown Florentine artist, and has been variously
    attributed to Andrea del Castagno, Fra Filippo Lippi, and Andrea
    Verrocchio, may be assigned to that nameless contemporary of Pesellino
    whose artistic personality was a few years ago constructed by Mrs.
    Berenson under the name of “Compagno di Pesellino.”</p>

  <p>The art of the Umbrian artist, Piero dei Franceschi (1415?–1492), who
    is so well represented in the National Gallery, is not seen at the
    Louvre, where, however, a <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> passes under his name.
    This panel (the official number of which is given in the Catalogue as
    1300B and on the frame as 1300<span class="smcap">a</span>) was formerly in the Duchâtel
    collection before passing into that of the Duc de la Trémoïlle, from
    whom it was purchased in 1898 for £5200 by the <cite>Société des Amis du
    Louvre</cite>. It was recognised over twelve years ago by M. Ary Renan as
    the work of Alessio Baldovinetti (1427<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>1499), who, like Piero dei
    Franceschi, was formed on Domenico Veneziano, and was also influenced
    by the discoveries and methods of Uccello.</p>

  <p>Crowe and Cavalcaselle also had made that attribution before the
    question was taken up by Mr. Berenson, who on morphological and
    æsthetic grounds unhesitatingly ascribes it to Baldovinetti. “Compared
    with Baldovinetti,” writes Mr. Berenson, “Piero dei Franceschi is
    sterner and harder and more monumental. Piero’s Madonnas have a fixed
    and severe physiognomy, massive structure and immobile pose; never a
    smile, never a touch of tenderness.” How different from all this is the
    <cite>Madonna</cite> by Baldovinetti before us, with her “refined features and
    her pensive gaze of adoration—a look that unveils her inner life, a
    look that will soon develop into the mystery which we feel in the face
    of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.” Vasari tells us that Baldovinetti
    was “extremely careful and exact in his work, and of all the minutiæ
    which Mother Nature is capable of presenting, he took pains to be the
    close imitator. He delighted in the representation of landscape, which
    he depicted with the utmost exactitude; thus we find in his pictures
    rivers, bridges, rocks, herbs, fruits, paths, fields, cities, castles,
    sands, and objects innumerable of the same kind.” A goodly number of
    these are included in the background of this picture.</p>

  <p>With Antonio Pollaiuolo (1429–1498) and his brother Piero (1443–1496)
    we enter on a more scientific era in Florentine art. Masaccio had
    already advanced the study of the nude, and the influence of Donatello
    (1386–1466) and other sculptors had drawn the attention of all
    art-workers to the fuller significance of the human form. A more
    serious attempt was now made by the rising generation of sculptors and
    painters, among whom Antonio Pollaiuolo and Verrocchio (1435–1488)
    now played the leading parts, to impart to the human figure a more
    exact physiological accuracy and so give it greater effectiveness. The
    advance made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> by Baldovinetti in landscape tended also to a more real
    sense of movement in a natural environment. The Louvre catalogues no
    picture under the name of either of the Pollaiuoli, but a <cite>Madonna</cite>
    (No. 1367<span class="smcap">a</span>) here credited to Bastiano Mainardi was probably
    executed by Piero, who frequently worked on his elder brother’s designs.</p>

  <p>The influence of Alessio Baldovinetti is reflected in the pictures of
    Cosimo Rosselli (1437–1507). Nothing is officially ascribed to him in
    this collection, but the <cite>Annunciation, with St. John the Baptist,
    St. Anthony, St. Catherine, and St. Peter Martyr</cite> (No. 1656), which
    is here catalogued as by an Unknown fifteenth-century Florentine
    painter, is apparently his work. It is inscribed with the date
    <span class="smcap">a.d.m.cccclxxiii</span>.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_GOLDSMITH_PAINTERS">THE GOLDSMITH PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>During the generation which preceded the activity of Domenico
    Ghirlandaio (1449–1494) (who appears in the official Catalogue under
    the name of Grillandaio) the art of the painter had often been combined
    with that of the architect and sculptor. In time the influence of the
    goldsmith is seen in the inclination of the more prosaic painters,
    among whom Ghirlandaio holds an important place, to subordinate the
    pictorial qualities of their compositions to the gold-worker’s love
    of ornamental detail and fanciful jewellery. Paintings carried out
    in the goldsmith’s shop thus contained in the action of the figures,
    the treatment of the draperies, and the fanciful head-dresses,
    imitations of silver and bronze work. Domenico Bigordi owed the name
    of Ghirlandaio, by which he is now generally known, to his having been
    apprenticed to a goldsmith who acquired fame as a maker of the jewelled
    coronals (<i lang="fr">ghirlande</i>) that became fashionable. This pupil of Alessio
    Baldovinetti, who was a craftsman quite as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> as a painter, is
    to-day best known by the large number of frescoes he painted in Tuscany.</p>

    jewelled architecture which bears the date 1491, three years previous
    to his death. The Catalogue suggests that this large picture was
    finished by either Davide or Benedetto, the brothers and assistants
    of Domenico, but it is possible that his brother-in-law, Bastiano
    Mainardi, may have worked on it. The French, having pointed out to the
    Duke of Tuscany in 1815 that Florence possessed many better examples of
    this painter’s art, were allowed to retain this panel picture, which
    had been brought in 1806 from the Church of S. Maria Maddalena dei
    Pazzi at Florence.</p>

  <p>The delightful <cite>Portrait of an Old Man and his Grandson</cite> (No. 1322,
    <a href="#i_plate03">Plate III.</a>), which is usually known as <cite>The Bottle-nosed Man</cite>, is an
    admirable study from life. The winsome attitude of the little boy and
    the refined expression of the old man are very pleasing. It is an
    incontrovertible, but perhaps not obvious, fact that mere physiological
    ugliness can in the hands of an accomplished artist be transformed into
    a medium of beauty. The picture has unfortunately been damaged, notably
    in the forehead of the principal figure. The certainty of touch and the
    delicacy of the modelling indicate that this panel belongs to the last
    period of the artist’s activity, when he also executed the magnificent
    <cite>Portrait of Giovanna degli Albizzi</cite>, now in the collection of Mr. J.
    Pierpont Morgan.</p>

  <p>One of Domenico’s brothers, Benedetto Ghirlandaio (1458–1497)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> is
    credited with a <cite>Christ on the Way to Calvary</cite> (No. 1323). His own
    son, Ridolfo (1483–1561), painted the <cite>Coronation of the Virgin</cite> (No.
    1324) in 1503, the date being inscribed on the panel. Mainardi (fl.
    1482–1513), the brother-in-law, pupil, and imitator of Domenico,
    painted many pictures which usually pass under the name of his more
    illustrious relation. This pupil has painted in the tondo of the
    <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1367) a morse somewhat similar to that seen
    in the <cite>Visitation</cite> (No. 1321). In this same group of artists must be
    placed a nameless assistant of Domenico. His pictures have been grouped
    by Mr. Berenson, who calls him by the descriptive name of “Alunno di
    Domenico,” and tentatively identifies him with Bartolommeo di Giovanni,
    of whom very little is known. Alunno di Domenico is thus credited with
    having executed the companion pictures (No. 1416<span class="smcap">a</span> and No.
    1416<span class="smcap">b</span>) of the <cite>Nuptials of Thetis and Peleus</cite>, a pagan subject
    which suggests the advent of the decadence in Florentine art. These two
    panels are officially catalogued under the name of Piero di Cosimo.</p>

  <h3 id="LEONARDO_DA_VINCI">LEONARDO DA VINCI</h3>

  <p>We now have to pass from the mediocre artists who worked in the school
    of Domenico Ghirlandaio to that great master, Leonardo da Vinci
    (1452–1519), whose work in the oil medium can nowhere be studied so
    profitably as in the Louvre. This many-sided genius was the natural
    and first-born son of a country notary, and became a pupil of the
    sculptor-painter, Andrea del Verrocchio, in whose workshop he met
    Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, and many less distinguished Florentine
    painters. His interests and occupations were so various that a
    detailed study of his life-work reveals him as scientist, philosopher,
    architect, sculptor, military engineer, mathematician, botanist, and
    musician. The <cite>Annunciation</cite> (catalogued as No. 1602<span class="smcap">a</span> and
    labelled No. 1265), which in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> official Catalogue is now only
    attributed to him after having long passed under the name of Lorenzo
    di Credi, is doubtless an early work of about 1472 by Leonardo. Some
    ten years later Leonardo entered the service of Lodovico Sforza, Duke
    of Milan, in which city he shortly afterwards painted the <cite>Virgin
    of the Rocks</cite> (No. 1599). This fine painting—whose virtues are
    concealed under a thick coat of chilled varnish—is reputed to have
    been in the collection of François <span class="smcap">i.</span>, although it has no
    continuous pedigree earlier than the year 1625, when it was in the
    royal collection at Fontainebleau. It is very similar to the painting
    of the same subject which the National Gallery (No. 1093) purchased
    in 1880 for £9000. The points of difference between the two versions
    are numerous but trifling. The nimbi in the National Gallery picture
    were added much later and are not found in the Louvre panel, which in
    the greater perfection of detail, in the treatment of the foreground
    and the brushwork, prove it to be an earlier and more authentic work.
    A careful examination of the documents which came to light in the
    year 1893 shows that a dispute arose as to the price to be paid by
    the Brotherhood of the Conception of Milan for the picture now in the
    Louvre, and that Ambrogio da Predis and Leonardo da Vinci petitioned
    the Duke of Milan to intervene. It would seem that the National Gallery
    picture was executed in great part by Ambrogio, who worked under the
    supervision of the great Florentine master, in 1494, about twelve
    years later than the version in this collection. Leonardo’s greatest
    contribution to Florentine art consisted in his practice of the
    science of <i lang="fr">chiaroscuro</i>, the laws of which he was the first to fully
    investigate.</p>

  <p>Having begun his celebrated “Treatise on Painting” and recommenced his
    work on the colossal equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza, which at
    the moment of its destruction by the French bowmen in 1500 had earned
    him lasting fame as a sculptor, Leonardo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> undertook his <i lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</i>,
    <cite>The Last Supper</cite>, at Milan. Executed in tempera on a badly prepared
    stucco ground, the painting unfortunately soon began to perish, and
    although it was restored in 1908 with great success by Professor
    Cavenaghi, only a faint idea of its pristine beauty remains. The Louvre
    possesses a contemporary copy (No. 1603<span class="smcap">a</span>) of this fresco by
    Marco d’Oggiono, which was commissioned by the Constable de Montmorency
    and long hung in the Château d’Ecouen. A similar copy of Leonardo’s
    <cite>Last Supper</cite> was purchased from a grocer in Milan in 1793 for £600,
    and is now in the Royal Academy, London.</p>

  <h3 id="MONA_LISA">MONA LISA</h3>

  <p>When Lodovico Sforza was conquered by the French and his city occupied
    by them, Leonardo set out for Mantua and Florence. It may have been in
    the spring or summer of 1500 that he began to work on the <cite>Portrait
    of Mona Lisa</cite> (No. 1601, <a href="#i_plate04">Plate IV.</a>) which officially passes under the
    title of <cite>La Joconde</cite>. Vasari says that Leonardo worked on this picture
    for four years, and finally left it unfinished. The words of Vasari
    must not be taken too literally. We know, in fact, that Leonardo did
    not work in Florence for four consecutive years during the period to
    which the Louvre’s treasured picture belongs, but in 1502 visited
    Orvieto, Pœsaro, and Rimini, acting as engineer to Cesare Borgia.
    He probably began it in 1500, resumed work on it in 1503, and did
    not complete it until the following year. This would make Vasari’s
    statement substantially correct. The subject of this world-famous
    portrait was Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini, the third wife
    of Francesco di Bartolommeo de Zenobi del Giocondo, whom she married
    in 1495. It is from the surname of her husband that she derives the
    name of “<cite>La Joconde</cite>” by which her portrait is now officially known.
    (The title has nothing to do with any reference to her jocund outlook
    on life.) A French critic has shown that Mona Lisa’s child died while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    this portrait was being painted. “Whoever shall desire to see how far
    Art can imitate Nature,” says Vasari, “may do so to perfection in
    this head, wherein every peculiarity that could be depicted by the
    utmost subtlety of the pencil has been faithfully reproduced. The
    eyes have the lustrous brightness and moisture which is seen in life,
    and around them are those pale, red, and slightly livid circles also
    proper to Nature. The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate
    nostrils, might be easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable
    in its outline, has the lips uniting the rose tints of their colour
    with those of the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of
    the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood.”
    This eulogistic criticism may seem to-day to be somewhat excessive,
    but allowance must be made for the drastic restorations to which the
    panel has been subjected from time to time. As early as 1625 it is
    recorded to have been in a bad condition. Tradition says that it was
    purchased by François <span class="smcap">i.</span> for 4000 <i lang="fr">écus d’or</i>, equal to-day to
    about £1800, and hung in the <cite>Cabinet doré</cite> at Fontainebleau. Cassiano
    del Pozzo has left it on record that the Duke of Buckingham, in 1625,
    when he was sent to escort Henrietta Maria to England as the bride of
    Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>, expressed the hope that he might be permitted to
    take the picture back with him as a present from Henri <span class="smcap">iv.</span> of
    France, who was with difficulty prevented by his courtiers from acting
    on the suggestion. The picture was at Versailles during the reign of
    Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>., and appeared in the Louvre for the first time
    at the Revolution. In recent years it has been placed in an excellent
    frame of the period.</p>

  <p>By May 1506 Leonardo had returned to Milan, and there entered the
    service of the French king. About 1508–12 he seems to have worked upon
    the <cite>Madonna, Infant Christ, and St. Anne</cite> (No. 1598), which appears
    to have been in part executed by an assistant, possibly Salaino. This
    large panel was purchased by Cardinal Richelieu in 1629. A sketch by
    Leonardo for part of this picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> is in the Louvre (Drawing No. 391);
    other sketches are in the Venice Academy and in the Royal Library,
    Windsor. The name of Andrea Salaino (fl. 1495–1515) has been put
    forward as the painter of the mysterious picture entitled <cite>St. John
    the Baptist</cite> (No. 1597), which was evidently painted from a female
    model. It is difficult to accept the view put forward by Théophile
    Gautier that in this androgynous figure we have “another portrait
    of <cite>La Joconde</cite>, more mysterious, more strange, freed from material
    likeness, and showing the soul through the veil of the body.” The
    picture passed into the collection of Charles I. from Louis XIII. in
    exchange for Holbein’s <cite>Portrait of Erasmus</cite> (No. 2715, <a href="#i_plate24">Plate XXIV.</a>)
    and a now unrecognisable <cite>Holy Family</cite> by Titian, but on the dispersal
    of the English king’s collection was purchased for £140 by Jabach,
    from whom it ultimately passed to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> It is a Milanese
    production, but not, in all probability, from the hand of Leonardo
    himself, although officially so regarded. The same criticism applies
    to the so-called <cite>Portrait of Lucrezia Crivelli</cite> (No. 1600). Lucrezia
    was a lady-in-waiting to Beatrice d’Este, and in 1496 Lodovico Sforza
    became enamoured of her, a historical event which has no bearing on the
    identity of this portrait or on its official, although uncertain, claim
    to strict authenticity. It has also been described under the misleading
    title of <cite>La Belle Ferronnière</cite>, apparently in reference to the wife
    of one Ferron, a blacksmith, who had according to tradition been the
    mistress of François <span class="smcap">i.</span>, but was already dead when Leonardo
    passed into the service of that king and came to France in 1516. The
    picture’s pedigree cannot be traced further back than 1645, and the
    theories put forward in connection with it are largely conjectural.
    It is, however, a Milanese production of the school of Leonardo. <cite>The
    Profile Portrait of a Woman</cite> (No. 1605) was also a century ago loosely
    described as the <cite>Portrait of La Belle Ferronnière</cite>; it is catalogued
    as a school picture, but is regarded by Mr. Berenson as the work of
    Bernardino de’ Conti. The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> critic is of the opinion that the
    <cite>Bacchus</cite> (No. 1602) is “based no doubt on a drawing by Leonardo,”
    but the Catalogue accepts it unhesitatingly. It seems to have been
    originally intended as a St. John the Baptist with a staff, and
    subsequently altered into a Bacchus with a thyrsus. The <cite>Madonna and
    Child</cite> (No. 1603<span class="smcap">a</span>), an attributed work, is only an old Flemish
    copy of a slightly warped panel picture of the <cite>Madonna with the
    Carnation</cite> (No. 1040<span class="smcap">a</span>) at Munich. The <cite>Madonna of the Scales</cite>
    (No. 1604), which still passes as a school picture, has long been
    regarded by responsible critics as being by Cesare da Sesto, a pupil of
    Leonardo. <cite>The Holy Family</cite> (No. 1606), which was formerly in the His
    de la Salle collection, is not now exhibited.</p>

  <p>In 1516, within three years of his death, the great Florentine left
    Italy for the Manor House of Cloux, near Amboise, in Touraine, to enter
    the service of the French king. His right hand was paralysed—he was
    left-handed and wrote from right to left—and his health was failing
    fast. The end of that great life came on May 2, 1519, when every one
    lamented the loss of a man and a painter “whose like Nature cannot
    produce a second time.”</p>

  <p>The <cite>Madonna and Child, St. Julian, and St. Nicholas</cite> (No. 1263) is
    perhaps the masterpiece of Lorenzo di Credi (1456?–1537), who was
    another pupil of Verrocchio. He also painted the <cite>Christ appearing to
    Mary Magdalene</cite> (No. 1264). The <cite>Annunciation</cite> (No. 1602<span class="smcap">a</span>),
    which was formerly assigned to Lorenzo in the Catalogue (No. 1265), is,
    as has already been pointed out, an early work by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

  <h3 id="BOTTICELLI">BOTTICELLI</h3>

  <p>The ever-increasing regard in which pictures by Botticelli (1444–1510)
    are held is traceable to the fact that they show the mystic spirit of
    mediæval times mingled with a fantasy that is almost modern. He was a
    pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi, and studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> the more scientific methods
    which Antonio Pollaiuolo adopted in his treatment of the human figure.
    Painting in an age when poets penned canzones to many mistresses, and
    lovelorn gallants spoke in impassioned verse of the great platonic
    emotions which stirred them to the depth of their love-tormented
    souls, Botticelli stands forward as the representative of the later
    years of the Medicean age. The mystic tendency of his genius, his
    poetic imagination, his highly developed sense of linear design, and
    the charm of his colour impart to his works a delicacy and refinement
    which distinguish them from the works of his contemporaries, pupils,
    and imitators. His fame had long been in eclipse when half a century
    ago Ruskin rescued it from oblivion. Botticelli, who now has become the
    object of a cult at the hands of fervent enthusiasts, is, however, not
    to be ranked as a supreme master. He cannot be placed on the same plane
    as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Giorgione.</p>

  <p>Botticelli is inadequately represented at the Louvre, which possesses
    only two authentic paintings from his hand. Neither of these is on
    panel or canvas, but in fresco. He was commissioned in 1486, the year
    following his <cite>Mars and Venus</cite> in the National Gallery (No. 915), to
    execute two wall paintings (No. 1297, <a href="#i_plate05">Plate V.</a>, and No. 1298) in the
    hall on the <i lang="fr">piano nobile</i> of the Villa Lemmi, at Chiasso Macerelli,
    between Fiesole and Florence, to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo
    Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi. These exquisite, but much
    injured, frescoes were covered over with whitewash until 1873, and
    in 1882 they were removed from the wall and sold to the Louvre for
    £1860. In the first (No. 1298) of the series <cite>Lorenzo Tornabuoni,
    as Bridegroom, is admitted into the Circle of the Liberal Arts</cite>,
    who give a gracious welcome to this friend of all the Muses. This
    fresco, curiously enough, is in the official Catalogue regarded as
    only a school picture. The second of these wonderful creations depicts
    <cite>Giovanna Tornabuoni and the Three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> Graces</cite> (No. 1297, <a href="#i_plate05">Plate V.</a>). We
    see the Three Graces bringing to Giovanna their gifts of Chastity,
    Beauty, and Love, depicted symbolically as flowers. A tragic fate
    awaited the loving pair, as Giovanna died within a few years in
    childbirth, while Lorenzo was condemned to death in 1497 for conspiracy.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Madonna and Child and St. John</cite> (No. 1296), which was formerly
    put forward by one critic as a “work of Botticelli’s early years, but
    showing collaboration,” and which is still catalogued as being by the
    master himself, is now generally recognised as a school picture only.
    The background is formed by cypresses and rosebushes. The circular
    panel (No. 1295), which is still credited officially to Sandro, is only
    a copy of the <cite>Madonna of the Magnificat</cite> now in the Uffizi at Florence
    (No. 1267 <i>Bis</i>).</p>

  <p>Authenticity cannot be claimed for the <cite>Fragment of a Predella</cite> (No.
    1300), containing the figures of St. Peter Martyr, the Virgin, St.
    Elizabeth, Christ and the Magdalene, David, St. Francis, St. Dominic,
    and St. John the Baptist. The <cite>Scene from the History of Virginia</cite> (No.
    1662<span class="smcap">a</span> or No. 1662 <i>Bis</i>), a cassone front, and the <cite>Portrait
    of a Young Man</cite> (No. 1663), which was purchased in 1882 for £600, are
    catalogued as being by an unknown Florentine painter. These have,
    however, been included by Mr. Berenson among the numerous pictures
    painted by the nameless imitator of Botticelli, whom the eminent critic
    has identified under the significant name of “Amico di Sandro,” <i>i.e.</i>
    “The friend of Sandro Botticelli.” The <cite>Madonna and Child adored by
    Angels</cite> (No. 1300<span class="smcap">a</span>), bequeathed by the Baroness Nathaniel de
    Rothschild, is regarded by the same high authority as a copy by Jacopo
    del Sellaio (1442?–1493), a pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi and an imitator
    of Botticelli, of a lost picture by “Amico di Sandro.” The unbeautiful
    <cite>Venus</cite> (No. 1299) from the Cardinal Fesch and Campana collections
    (which is very similar to a picture (No. 916) in the National Gallery),
    the <cite>Esther crowned by Ahasuerus</cite> (No. 1643<span class="smcap">a</span>), and the <cite>St.
    Jerome</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> (No. 1658), must also be included among the mediocre works of
    Sellaio. In the same group of Florentine painters is placed Francesco
    Botticini (1446–1497), who worked under and was influenced by Cosimo
    Rosselli (1437?–1507); <cite>the Virgin in Glory between the Magdalene and
    St. Bernard</cite> (No. 1482) is by Botticini although placed under the name
    of Rosselli in the Catalogue. Many pictures by Botticini pass in public
    galleries under the more illustrious name of Botticelli.</p>

  <p>From Cosimo Rosselli we naturally pass to his pupil Piero di Cosimo
    (1462–1521), who derived great pleasure from the painting of such
    scenes from classic fable as enabled him to depict grotesque monsters,
    strange animals, and fantastic costume. At first sight it might be
    assumed that the <cite>Nuptials of Thetis and Peleus</cite> (No. 1416<span class="smcap">a</span>
    and No. 1416<span class="smcap">b</span>) were from his brush; but although these two
    panels pass under his name in the Catalogue, they are, as we have seen,
    by “Alunno di Domenico.” Piero is represented in the Louvre exclusively
    by religious pictures, the most imposing of which is the <cite>Coronation
    of the Virgin, with St. Jerome, St. Francis, St. Bonaventura, and St.
    Louis of Toulouse</cite> (No. 1416). An unpleasing <cite>Madonna</cite> (No. 1662) has
    long ago been assigned to Piero di Cosimo, who is also the author of a
    <cite>St. John the Baptist as a Child</cite> (No. 1274), which is labelled with
    the name of Uccello. The two last pictures hang in the Long Gallery on
    either side of the door leading into Room VII.</p>

  <p>The authorities catalogue as the work of Raffaelino del Garbo
    (1466–1524) the large <cite>Coronation of the Virgin, with St. Benedict, St.
    Salvi, St. John Gualberto, and St. Bernard degli Uberti</cite> (No. 1303),
    which is in reality the centre part of a large altarpiece by Raffaelle
    dei Carli (1470–1526?), who worked with Garbo and his group.</p>

  <p>The great French Museum does not possess one of the only three easel
    paintings which are now assigned by the safest critics to Michelangelo
    (1475–1564), who as a painter is best known for his fresco paintings
    in Rome. This collection is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> fortunate enough to own the two
    sculptures of the <cite>Slaves</cite>, represented as fettered and overcome by
    grief at the death of Pope Julius <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, for whose tomb they
    were intended.</p>

  <h3 id="ALBERTINELLI">ALBERTINELLI</h3>

  <p>By the end of the fifteenth century, Florence had become the æsthetic
    capital of Italy, and painters innumerable were plying their trade
    within her walls. As they worked in close contact and unconsciously
    reflected the influences which beset them on every side, it becomes
    increasingly difficult to assign to any given artist the execution
    of certain works. The task becomes even more difficult, and indeed
    thankless, when one is brought face to face with such a composite
    picture as the <cite>Madonna and Child, St. Jerome and St. Zenobius</cite> (No.
    1114), which is officially ascribed to Albertinelli (1474–1515). The
    leading authority on Italian art has given it as his opinion that this
    large canvas, which is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">
    MARIOCTI DEBERTINELLIS OPUS<br />
    Ā. D̄. M̊. DVI,
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">was “begun by Filippino Lippi, who laid in the St. Jerome, while
    Albertinelli was assisted by Bugiardini in the execution of the rest,
    especially in the child and landscape.” Albertinelli was the intimate
    friend of Fra Bartolommeo, whose partner he eventually became. When it
    is remembered that Albertinelli worked in the studio of Cosimo Rosselli
    with Piero di Cosimo, who was the master of Fra Bartolommeo and had
    some influence on Filippino Lippi, it will be recognised that it is
    only the discerning critic of wide experience and consummate <em>flair</em>
    that can detect the hand of various painters in a composite picture of
    this kind, as Mr. Berenson has done.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

  <p>The <cite>Christ appearing to the Magdalene</cite> (No. 1115), which passes
    officially as the work of Albertinelli, was most probably an early
    picture by Fra Bartolommeo (1472–1517), who, having like Botticelli
    come under the spell of Savonarola, took the vows of a Dominican in
    July 1500, and temporarily relinquished the professional activity of a
    painter. The Frate took up his brush again and, while working between
    1509 and 1512 as the partner of Albertinelli, achieved the large and
    imposing <cite>Holy Family, with St. Peter, St. Vincent, St. Stephen, and
    St. Catherine of Siena on the left, and St. Dominic, St. Francis, and
    St. Bartholomew on the right</cite> (No. 1154). It is signed on the base of
    the throne, in characteristic manner:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">
    ORATE PRO PICTORE<br />
    MDXI<br />
    BARTHOLOME FLOREN̄.<br />
    OR. PRAE.
  </div>

  <p>Four years later he also completed his Annunciation (No. 1153), which
    is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center lh2">
    <i>F. Bart<sup>o</sup> Floren<sup>s</sup> or<sup>is</sup> pre.<br />
    1515.</i>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The introduction of St. Paul, St. John the Baptist, and St. Margaret on
    the left, and St. Mary Magdalene and St. Francis on the right, tends to
    destroy the full significance of the principal theme. Fra Bartolommeo’s
    pictures helped to emancipate Raphael from the mannerisms he had
    acquired from Perugino; they mark a late period in the Renaissance art
    of Florence. He lived until 1517, when Florentine painting was on the
    verge of a fast approaching decadence.</p>

  <p>Equally influential in the art of this period was Filippino Lippi
    (1457–1504), whose tendency to over-ornamentation be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>came more
    advanced in his later years. In his fascinating pictures spiritual
    significance is at times sacrificed to a love of mere display, the
    baroque flutterings of his draperies and the air of affectation that
    he sometimes imparted to his figures. The Louvre exhibits no example
    of the art of Filippino which in its latest phase shows the early,
    although unmistakable, signs of decline.</p>

  <h3 id="ANDREA_DEL_SARTO">ANDREA DEL SARTO</h3>

  <p>The highly technical skill and mellow colouring of Andrea del Sarto
    (1486–1531) have long been known in France, where he was invited by
    François <span class="smcap">i.</span> For that monarch he executed the <cite>Charity</cite> (No.
    1514), which, having been transferred from panel to canvas by Picault
    in 1750 when the process was little understood, suffered accordingly.
    In its present state we can get little idea of the former brilliance
    of the picture which secured to the “faultily faultless painter” in
    1518—the year he arrived in France—a very considerable income. It is
    inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">
    ANDREAS SARTUS<br />
    FLORENTINTUS ME PINXIT<br />
    MDXVIII.
  </div>

  <p>A <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No 1515), by the same facile painter, has been said by
    some to portray in the features of the Virgin those of his own infamous
    wife Lucrezia del Fede. It has been enlarged, and has suffered in the
    operation. Less authentic are the <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1516), which is
    said to bear the inscription:</p>

  <div class="center small">ANDREA DEL SARTO FLORENTINO FACIEBAT</div>

  <p class="noindent">followed by a monogram, and a lunette of the <cite>Annunciation</cite> (No. 1517).
    The <cite>Portrait of Andrea Fausti</cite>, which is given in the Catalogue under
    the name of Sarto, and described as being the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> work of a pupil, is held
    by some critics to have been painted by Franciabigio (1482–1525), who
    came under the influence of Andrea.</p>

  <p>The insignificant <cite>Portrait of a Young Man</cite> (No. 1506), which since
    1709 has passed under the quite fictitious title of the <cite>Portrait
    of Raphael</cite>, and is indeed still catalogued under his name, is an
    ill drawn and badly coloured production. It seems to issue from the
    influences we have just outlined. Morelli regarded it as the work
    of Bacchiacca (1494–1557), who churned up reminiscences of Andrea
    del Sarto, Franciabigio, and Perugino. Mr. Berenson has tentatively
    assigned it to Sogliani, who imitated Albertinelli and many other
    Florentines.</p>

  <p>An unattributed Florentine <cite>Portrait of a Young Man</cite> (No. 1644),
    which has been enlarged about three inches all round, had at one time
    or another been ascribed without much discrimination to Raphael,
    Giorgione, Sebastiano del Piombo, Francesco Francia, Ridolfo
    Ghirlandaio, and Franciabigio! It is apparently from the hand of
    Giuliano Bugiardini (1475–1554), a mediocre artist who endeavoured to
    appropriate all the conflicting influences that he came under. It has
    long been hung to the left of Raphael’s <cite>La Belle Jardinière</cite>.</p>

  <p>A Florentine painter of no great accomplishment or originality in the
    first half of the sixteenth century was Jacopo da Pontormo (1494–1557),
    who painted the <cite>Portrait of an Engraver of Precious Stones</cite> (No.
    1241) and the large <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1240). The <cite>Visitation</cite> (No.
    1242) is a copy by a pupil of his fresco in the Annunziata, Florence.
    By another pupil, Agnolo Bronzino (1502–1572), are the <cite>Christ and
    the Magdalene</cite> (No. 1183), not now exhibited, and the <cite>Portrait of a
    Sculptor</cite> (No. 1184); the <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1183<span class="smcap">a</span> or No.
    1183<span class="smcap">b</span>) which was formerly in the Vandeuil collection is only
    a copy. Giovanni Battista Rosso (1496–1541), who is called Rosso
    Fiorentino to distinguish him from Francesco Rosso (Il Salviati), came
    to work at the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> Court about 1530; he painted a <cite>Pietà</cite> (No.
    1485), and a <cite>Challenge of the Pierides</cite> (No. 1486), which are hung
    among the French pictures. <cite>The Portrait of a Musician</cite> (No. 1608),
    by Paolo Zacchia; the <cite>Madonna, St. John and St. Stephen</cite> (No. 1133),
    by Michelangelo Anselmi; the <cite>David overcoming Goliath</cite> (No. 1462),
    a repulsive production painted by Daniele da Volterra (Ricciarelli)
    on both sides of a large piece of slate; a <cite>Flight into Egypt</cite> (No.
    1209), by Lodovico Cardi (Il Cigoli), and Matteo Rosselli’s <cite>Triumph of
    David</cite> (No. 1483), are unworthy of comment. They show unmistakably the
    characteristics of the Decadence in full operation. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_LATER_SIENESE_SCHOOL">THE LATER SIENESE SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WE have already sketched the earliest period of the art of Siena, and
    seen how for a brief space of time it dominated that of Tuscany. The
    greater precision of the Florentine technique, and the wider mental
    outlook of its artists in the fifteenth century, placed it in the van
    before long.</p>

  <p>Sano di Pietro (1406–1481), a pupil of Sassetta, undoubtedly painted
    the five small characteristic panels (No. 1128–32), which illustrate
    scenes from the <cite>Life of St. Jerome</cite>, and at one time formed the
    predella of a large altarpiece. St. Jerome, with others of his order
    who run away, kneels under a portico of the monastery he founded at
    Bethlehem, and is extracting a thorn from the lion’s paw. According to
    the legend, the lion was afterwards placed in charge of an ass which
    the monks employed to carry wood; we see here that while the lion was
    asleep in the heat of the day under a clump of trees, the ass was
    stolen by merchants. St. Jerome naturally believed that the ass had
    not been carried off by a passing caravan, but eaten by the lion, who
    subsequently saw his old friend the ass in the possession of the same
    merchants that chanced to pass that way again. The lion is here seen
    (No. 1130) in the act of compelling, one might almost say pushing, the
    ass and the other beasts of burden laden with provisions back into the
    monastery, while the merchants flee away in terror.</p>

  <p>The Louvre does not contain any work by Vecchietta (1412–1480), who
    was architect as well as painter. A <cite>Birth of the Virgin</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> (No. 1660),
    catalogued as being by an unknown Florentine artist, is most probably
    from the hand of Matteo di Giovanni (1435?–1495), who was most likely
    at one time a pupil of Vecchietta. Another of the latter’s pupils,
    Francesco di Giorgio (1439–1502), perhaps executed the panel of the
    <cite>Rape of Europa</cite> (No. 1640<span class="smcap">a</span> or No. 1640 <i>Bis</i>), which the
    cataloguer relegates to the lengthy list of unattributed Florentine
    works.</p>

  <p>From these influences spring Girolamo di Benvenuto (1470–1524), whose
    <cite>Judgment of Paris</cite> (No. 1668) passes in the Catalogue as a late
    fifteenth century Bolognese picture. Bernardino Fungai (1460–1516), who
    trod in the steps of Giovanni di Paolo, Francesco di Giorgio, and the
    Umbrian artist Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, and yet evinced no real signs of
    development from within, is unrepresented in this collection.</p>

  <p>This rapid survey of the School of Siena shows that it is not well
    exemplified in the Louvre. The third-rate painters, Pacchiarotto
    (1474–1540) and Beccafumi (1486–1551), will not detain us. Another
    accomplished late Sienese eclectic, Girolamo del Pacchia (1477–1535?),
    has been credited with a <cite>Crucifixion</cite> (No. 1642), but not by the
    official cataloguer. Sodoma (1477–1551) also worked in Siena. Towards
    the year 1501 other artists of the various schools of Central Italy,
    including Pinturicchio, Signorelli, and Perugino, visited the city,
    their advent bringing about an artistic revolution. Before long the
    religious fervour, the delicate ornamentation, the gesso-embellishment,
    the drawing in the flat, and the miniature-like delicacy of an earlier
    age became extinct. The artistic glory of Siena was dimmed, and rapidly
    passed into a period of decadence.</p>

  <p>Among the last Sienese artists of any distinction were Baldassare
    Peruzzi (1481–1536), an architect and painter, and Matteo Balducci (fl.
    1509–1553), to whom we may perhaps ascribe the <cite>Judgment of Solomon</cite>
    (No. 1571) and the <cite>Judgment of Daniel</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> (No. 1572). In any case
    these pictures belong to the Umbro-Sienese period of Central Italian
    art; they are officially regarded as being by Perugino himself. When
    all originality had passed out of Sienese painting, Francesco Vanni
    (1563?–1609) produced his <cite>Repose on the Flight into Egypt</cite> (No. 1561)
    and the <cite>Martyrdom of St. Irene</cite> (No. 1562). </p>

    <h2 id="THE_UMBRIAN_SCHOOL">THE UMBRIAN SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AT the head of the various local centres of painting which form the
    school of Umbria we must place Alegretto Nuzi (died 1385), whose works
    are very rarely met with in museums north of Italy. He inherited
    the best Giottesque traditions, and became the teacher of Gentile
    da Fabriano (1360?–1428), an early master whose influence was more
    far-reaching and inspiring than we can to-day trace in any detail.
    The Louvre has the good fortune to contain a precious little predella
    panel of the <cite>Presentation in the Temple</cite> (No. 1278), which is very
    decorative and exhibits a strongly marked appreciation of architecture.
    It is the only separated panel from the predella of Gentile’s large
    and magnificent altarpiece of the <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite>, of 1423,
    which was seized by Napoleon but was returned in 1815. It is now in the
    Accademia at Florence.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Miracle of St. Nicholas giving a Dowry to the Three Daughters
    of a Nobleman</cite> (No. 1659), which is officially classed among the
    unattributable works of the Florentine school, is now considered to be
    by Giovanni Francesco da Rimini, while the <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No.
    1300<span class="smcap">a</span> or 1300<span class="smcap">b</span>) which is officially ascribed to Piero
    dei Franceschi, the leading painter of his generation in the school of
    Umbria, must, as we have seen, be given to Alessio Baldovinetti of the
    Florentine school.</p>

  <p>Again, the three-panel picture (No. 1415) which is credited to
    Pesellino of Florence is in reality from the hand of the Umbrian
    artist Fiorenzo di Lorenzo (1440–1521). The collection is not rich in
    the works of the earliest painters of this school, but the <cite>Birth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
    the Virgin</cite> (No. 1525), a detached panel from a lost or unidentified
    altarpiece by Luca Signorelli (1441–1523), gives us some idea of the
    great power of this influential master, whose knowledge of composition
    and anatomy is best seen in his frescoes at Orvieto. Signorelli’s sense
    of complicated movement and crowded action mark an epoch in the art of
    Umbria. The <cite>Fragment of a Large Picture</cite> (No. 1527) seems to be imbued
    with his spirit, but the large <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite> (No. 1526) which
    comes from Città di Castello, and a <cite>Madonna and Child with St. Louis
    of Toulouse, St. Catherine, and other Saints</cite> (No. 1528), contain none
    of the vigorous originality of that master from whom even Michelangelo
    did not disdain to borrow on occasion. Three predella panels (No. 1120)
    have been dismembered from a large altarpiece by Niccolò da Foligno,
    and were originally painted for a side altar in the Church of S.
    Niccolò at Foligno. In the art of this over-emotional Umbrian, what is
    meant for deep religious feeling is by exaggeration almost transformed
    into grimacing passion.</p>

  <h3 id="PERUGINO">PERUGINO</h3>

  <p>Niccolò’s most illustrious contemporary in this school was Pietro
    Perugino (1446–1523). Over fifty of the religious pictures of this
    influential and accomplished master were carried off from Central Italy
    by Napoleon. He is well represented in this Gallery. The contemplative
    and deeply impressive pictures of his less mannered style are among
    the best pictures which Umbria has given us, but there is a tendency,
    notably towards the end of his career, to repeat his compositions,
    only altering the attitude of a single figure, and so exhibiting a
    marked lack of originality. His early <cite>Holy Family with St. Rose and
    St. Catherine</cite> (No. 1564), painted about 1491, is a little cramped;
    the tondo hardly provides sufficient space to contain the rather
    stiff figures, and the treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> is unpleasantly conventional. It
    also recalls the art of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. The <cite>St. Sebastian</cite> (No.
    1566<span class="smcap">a</span>, <a href="#i_plate06">Plate VI.</a>), which is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small">SAGITTÆ TVÆ INFIXÆ SVNT MICHI,</div>

  <p class="noindent">is a favourite subject with this master, who painted it at least eight
    times on a large scale, as well as in a miniature now lent to the
    National Gallery by Mr. H. Yates Thompson. The <cite>Holy Family with St.
    Catherine</cite> (No. 1565) is said to bear the characteristic signature:</p>

  <div class="center small">PETRUS PERVSINUS PINXIT.</div>

  <p>The <cite>Combat of Love and Chastity</cite> (No. 1567) was commissioned by
    Isabella d’Este, Duchess of Mantua, in 1505, and removed at the sack
    of that city in 1630 to the Château of Richelieu, where it remained
    down to the Revolution. The <cite>St. Paul</cite> (No. 1566) is a very late and
    not very attractive work. In his best pictures Perugino loved to paint
    a purist landscape with its buoyant spaciousness of view, but too
    frequently his figures are insufficiently dramatic and have a tendency
    towards sentimentality. A very late <cite>St. Sebastian</cite> (No. 1668<span class="smcap">a</span>),
    which is on a much smaller scale than the subject of our illustration
    (<a href="#i_plate06">Plate VI.</a>), is officially catalogued as being by an Unknown Umbrian
    painter. The <cite>Apollo and Marsyas</cite> (No. 1509), which was purchased at
    Christie’s in 1850 for £70 by Morris Moore, with an ascription to
    Mantegna, was in 1883 sold to the Louvre for £8000. It long hung in
    the Salon Carré as a Raphael, but is now only attributed to him by the
    cataloguer. This gem of Umbrian art has successively been ascribed by
    critics to Pintoricchio, Timoteo Viti, Francesco Francia, and others,
    but is to-day generally regarded as a very fine example of the art
    of Perugino. Two pictures (No. 1573 and No. 1573<span class="smcap">a</span>) of the
    <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> are by unidentifiable pupils of Perugino.</p>

  <p>One of the most recent acquisitions is a <cite>Madonna</cite> by Antoniazzo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
    Romano (1440?–1508), the gift of M. Lucien Delamarre. The art of
    Pintoricchio (1454–1513) is shown in the <cite>Madonna and Child with St.
    Gregory and another Saint</cite> (No. 1417), while Lo Spagna (1475?–1528?),
    a pupil of Perugino, is represented by a <cite>Nativity</cite> (No. 1539),
    a <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1540), and by three small pictures
    illustrating the <cite>Dead Christ, the Virgin, and St. John</cite> (No. 1568),
    <cite>St. Francis of Assisi receiving the Stigmata</cite> (No. 1569), and <cite>St.
    Jerome in the Desert</cite> (No. 1570).</p>

  <p>A mediocre pupil of Perugino and Pintoricchio, Giannicola Manni (fl.
    1493–1544), is doubtless responsible for the <cite>Baptism of Christ</cite> (No.
    1369), the <cite>Assumption</cite> (No. 1370), the <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite> (No.
    1371), and the <cite>Holy Family</cite> (1372) which pass under his name. The
    last-mentioned panel was attributed by Villot, apparently without much
    reason, to L’Ingegno.</p>

  <h3 id="RAPHAEL">RAPHAEL</h3>

  <p>The majority of the thirteen pictures which in the Louvre are
    unreservedly catalogued under the great name of Raphael (1483–1520)
    certainly belong to his third or Roman period, and in many of them
    he obviously received a large amount of assistance from his pupil,
    Giulio Romano. It is this fact, no doubt, which has led the compiler of
    the Catalogue to place the “Divine Urbinate” in the Roman school. It
    will, however, be readily admitted that such a classification is both
    arbitrary and misleading.</p>

  <p>Although he lived but thirty-seven years, Raphael gave to the world a
    vast amount of art treasure. Brought up in Urbino, where his father,
    Giovanni Santi, was poet as well as painter, he passed before he
    was fifteen under the direct influence of Timoteo Viti, who had
    worked at Bologna under Francesco Francia. Raphael became the pupil
    of Perugino at Perugia about 1500, and also worked as the assistant
    of Pintoricchio. His art <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>being thus formed on the best Umbrian
    tradition, Raphael in October 1504 left Perugia for Florence, and it
    was only at that date that he began to acquire a distinctive style of
    his own. During his second or Florentine period he painted the <cite>St.
    George and the Dragon</cite> (No. 1503), in which is seen the chivalrous
    knight mounted on a pure white steed; his lance is broken in his combat
    with the monster, and he is forced to use his sword, while the little
    Princess Cleodolinda flees in abject terror into the background. The
    very small panel of <cite>St. Michael</cite> (No. 1502), which is a chessboard on
    the back, was painted for Guidobaldo, Duke of Urbino, and eventually
    passed into the collections of Cardinal Mazarin and Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>
    The <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> which has come to be known as <cite>La Belle
    Jardinière</cite> (No. 1496, <a href="#i_plate07">Plate VII.</a>) is rather later than the <cite>Madonna
    del Gran’ Duca</cite> in the Pitti Palace, the <cite>Cardellino Madonna</cite> in the
    Uffizi, and the <cite>Ansidei Madonna</cite> in the National Gallery. It is one of
    the most famous of Raphael’s saintly and ideal Madonnas; the pose of
    the figures is easy, the treatment simple, the colour exquisite. The
    landscape background is poetic in feeling, and conveys the mood which
    makes this one of Raphael’s most pleasing creations. The thin feathery
    trees and the treatment of the Virgin’s hair are still Peruginesque,
    but the superiority of the pupil to the master is gradually making
    itself felt. The Infant Christ is standing on the right foot of His
    mother. Tradition says that Raphael entrusted to Ridolfo Ghirlandaio
    the task of painting in the blue of the Virgin’s garment. The drapery
    is apparently inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small">VRB. RAPHAELLO MDVII.</div>

  <p>After working for four years in Florence, Raphael went in the summer of
    1508 to Rome, where he achieved such a vast amount of work for Popes
    Julius <span class="smcap">ii.</span> and Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span> His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> work was increased by his
    appointment, on the death of Bramante in 1514, as Architect of St.
    Peter’s and Inspector of Antiquities.</p>

  <p>About 1515–16 Raphael delighted to paint the <cite>Portrait of Baldassare
    Castiglione</cite> (No. 1505, <a href="#i_plate08">Plate VIII.</a>), who was his lifelong friend and
    adviser as well as the author of <cite>Il Cortegiano</cite>. This picture, which
    is eloquent testimony to Raphael’s skill as a portrait painter, was
    originally on wood, but it was long ago transferred to canvas, which
    has unfortunately abraded, the paint having peeled off the hands. After
    the death of Castiglione in Spain, this picture which he had taken
    with him passed into the possession of the Duke of Mantua, and thence
    into the collection of Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>, where it seems to have
    been copied by Rubens. It subsequently became the property of a Dutch
    amateur named Van Asselen, and was copied by Rembrandt. Later, it was
    sold for 3500 florins to Don Alfonso Lopez, a collector at Amsterdam,
    and after figuring in the collection of Mazarin was acquired by Louis
    <span class="smcap">xiv.</span></p>

  <p>The <cite>Holy Family of Francis I.</cite> (No. 1498) was commissioned by Lorenzo
    de’ Medici and presented to the Queen of François <span class="smcap">i.</span> by Pope
    Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span> It was originally painted on wood, and was forwarded
    to Lyons on April 19, 1518. During the reign of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>
    it hung in the <i lang="fr">grand appartement</i> at Versailles, and having been
    placed near a fireplace had to be relined. It then had wings, but they
    were destroyed at the time of the Revolution. Although it is very
    ostentatiously signed</p>

  <p class="noindent">on the edge of the robe of the kneeling Madonna, there can be no
    question that it was only designed by Raphael, the execution being
    wholly or in great part carried out by the master’s best pupil, Giulio
    Romano. In the <cite>Sistine Madonna</cite> and such works as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>Raphael painted
    at this period entirely with his own hand we see that his technique
    had become masterly and his powers of composition had developed to the
    utmost. Compared with <cite>La Belle Jardinière</cite> of a decade earlier, a
    greater knowledge of craftsmanship has been accompanied by a loss of
    purity and simplicity.</p>

  <p>Two years before his death Raphael had designed the large but by no
    means imposing <cite>St. Michael overcoming Satan</cite> (No. 1504), the execution
    of which on panel was certainly due to Giulio Romano. It was a gift
    from Lorenzo de’ Medici to François <span class="smcap">i.</span>, the original cartoon
    being presented by Raphael to the Duke of Ferrara. This picture, like
    the <cite>Holy Family of Francis I.</cite>, was originally protected by folding
    wings, the inner sides of which were lined with green velvet, while the
    outer were gilded and painted with arabesques. The two pictures arrived
    at Fontainebleau in July 1518, having been carried on the back of mules
    by way of Florence and Lyons. As early as 1530 the <cite>St. Michael</cite> was
    restored by Primaticcio and by many others subsequently, notably in
    1752. The picture was transferred to canvas by Picault, who received
    for his labours the large sum of 11,500 <i>livres</i>, a sum quite out of
    proportion to its æsthetic or financial value to-day. It was again
    restored in 1776, 1800, and 1850. It is signed in gilt characters on
    the edge of the Archangel’s tunic:</p>

  <div class="center small">RAPHAEL VRBINAS PINGEBAT MDXVIII.</div>

  <p>The Demon is not shown, as in the early and small picture of the same
    subject (No. 1502), as a dragon, but as a half-human monster with
    horns and tail. The foreshortening is undoubtedly clever, but the
    picture is too instantaneous in its dramatic action. In the course of
    time the high lights have gone down and the shadows darkened in the
    metallic-looking figure of the Archangel.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Virgin with the Blue Diadem</cite> or the <cite>Virgin with the Veil</cite> (No.
    1497) is one of at least ten pictures in this collection which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> were
    carried out by Giulio Romano (1492?–1546). It is here credited to
    Raphael. It has been repeatedly restored. A very large number of
    replicas, variants, and old copies of this panel exist. The following
    “Raphaels” may be regarded as the work of Giulio: the <cite>Small Holy
    Family with St. Elizabeth</cite> (No. 1499); the much restored <cite>Saint
    Margaret</cite> (No. 1501); the <cite>Portrait of Joan of Arragon</cite> (No. 1507),
    whom Raphael apparently never saw; and the <cite>Portraits of Two Men
    seen to the Bust</cite> (which has been called <cite>Raphael and his Fencing
    Master</cite>) (No. 1508). Giulio certainly painted the <cite>Triumph of Titus
    and Vespasian</cite> (No. 1420), the <cite>Venus and Vulcan</cite> (No. 1421), and the
    <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 1422), which are catalogued under his name,
    and in all probability the three large Cartoons entitled <cite>A Triumph</cite>,
    <cite>The Triumph of Scipio</cite>, and <cite>The Taking and Burning of a City</cite>, which
    hang on the Escalier Daru. The <cite>Circumcision</cite> (No. 1438) which figures
    officially under the name of the Bolognese painter Bartolommeo Ramenghi
    (Il Bagnacavallo) (1484–1542) is by Giulio Romano.</p>

  <p>The fresco painting of <cite>The Eternal Father</cite> (No. 1512), which is
    now inserted over the door of the Salle des Primitifs (Room VII.),
    was certainly executed during the lifetime of Raphael, and probably
    under his supervision. It was painted for the chapel attached to the
    Villa Magliana, a favourite hunting-box of Pope Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span>, who
    commissioned it. It was purchased in 1873 for the large sum of £8280.</p>

  <p>From the hand of Giannicola Manni (fl. 1493–1544) come the <cite>Baptism of
    Christ</cite> (No. 1369), the <cite>Assumption</cite> (No. 1370), the <cite>Adoration of the
    Magi</cite> (No. 1371), and a <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1372), while a fully signed
    <cite>Dead Christ supported by Two Angels</cite> (No. 1400) is by the mediocre
    Umbrian artist Marco Palmezzano (fl. 1456–1538). The latter’s pupil,
    Zaganelli da Cottignola (1460?–1531), may have painted the <cite>Christ

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE conquest of Byzantium during the Fourth Crusade by Doge Enrico
    Dandolo in 1204, an epoch-making event in the history of Venice and
    Venetian art, strengthened the intercourse between the East and the
    City of the Lagoons. At the same time it riveted the fetters of
    Byzantinism on to the nascent art of Venice, to which it also imparted
    a sense of intense Oriental colour.</p>

  <p>The frescoes painted in Tuscany on the lines of Giottesque tradition
    and the environment under which its painters worked, in time gave
    to the Florentines a sense of line and form which produced a school
    of idealists: on the other hand, the colour-impressions created on
    the mind of the Venetian painter by the relics from the East and the
    brilliant mosaics which he saw around him resulted eventually in the
    formation of a school of colourists with a realistic tendency.</p>

  <p>It will cause little surprise that the Louvre contains no polyptych by
    the very early Venetians, Niccolò Semitecolo (fl. 1351–1400), Jacobello
    del Fiore (died 1439), and Michele Giambono (fl. 1420–1462). The
    Gallery possesses, however, a fourteenth-century Venetian arched panel
    of the <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1541) which is attributed to Stefano
    Veneziano.</p>

  <p>In the early fifteenth century the dominating influence exerted on
    the painters of Venice was that of Jacopo Bellini (1400?–1470), whose
    sons, Gentile and Giovanni, and son-in-law, Andrea Mantegna, were to
    shape the destinies of the school throughout the Renaissance. Jacopo’s
    drawing is seen in its full maturity in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> Sketch-book of about 1450
    which belongs to the Louvre but is not publicly exhibited. Another
    Sketch-book by him of about 1430 is one of the treasured possessions
    of the British Museum. Jacopo had in early life been the pupil of
    Gentile da Fabriano, who, together with Alegretto Nuzi, stands at the
    head of the Umbrian school, and of Antonio Pisanello (1397–1455),
    the medallist-painter who played such an important part in the art
    of Verona. Both Gentile da Fabriano and Pisanello worked for a time
    at Venice. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is not surprising
    to find that a <cite>Madonna and Child with a Donor</cite> (No. 1159<span class="smcap">a</span>,
    formerly No. 1279 and No. 171), which is now justly ascribed in the
    Catalogue to Jacopo Bellini, was long assigned officially to Gentile
    Bellini, although held by some critics to have been painted in the
    school of Pisanello. The name of the Donor in this picture is given
    in the Catalogue as Leonello d’Este and on the frame as Pandolfo
    Malatesta; it would, however, seem to be the portrait of Sigismondo
    Malatesta.</p>

  <p>Four small triptychs (Nos. 1280–83) from the Campana collection still
    pass officially under the ambiguous designation of “School of Gentile
    da Fabriano”; they may, however, without much doubt be ascribed to
    Antonio Vivarini, who remained outside the Bellini sphere of influence,
    and died about 1470.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_BELLINI">THE BELLINI</h3>

  <p>The sunny splendour of Venetian painting reached its zenith in the
    <i lang="it">bottega</i> of the Bellini. Gentile, who was sent to Constantinople with
    the authority of the Republic in 1479, painted portraits, ceremonial,
    religious, and historical pictures, many of which are on a large scale,
    while Giovanni was for many years the greatest teacher and the most
    influential painter in Venetian territory. Giovanni executed a large
    number of panels and canvases which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> in the period of his maturity
    exhibit a profound sense of dignity, beauty, religious feeling, and
    rich deep colour. Most of those which are signed in a <i lang="it">cartellino</i>
    “<span class="smcap">ioannes bellinus</span>” (in capitals and, of course, in pigment
    of the period) are authentic works from his own hand. The majority
    of those which bear what to the unpractised eye might be taken for
    his personal signature, but are only signed in uncials (“<i>Ioannes
    Bellinus</i>”), must be regarded as mere studio productions. In the
    sixteenth century no one was misled by these alternative methods of
    personal signature and studio-mark. Although the Louvre authorities
    catalogue two pictures under the name of Gentile and three under that
    of Giovanni, none of them is from the hand of either of these brothers.</p>

  <p>Bartolommeo Vivarini of Murano (fl. 1450–1499) was the pupil of
    Giovanni d’Allemagna, who worked in Venice, and Antonio Vivarini. He
    painted a large panel of <cite>St. John of Capistrano</cite> (No. 1607), which is
    signed and dated</p>

  <div class="center small">OPVS BARTHOLOMEI VI[V]ARINI DE MURAHO—1459.</div>

  <p>Alvise or Luigi Vivarini (fl. 1461–1503), the nephew of Bartolommeo,
    was the last and most distinguished painter in the Murano school. He
    carried on the old traditions of Early Venetian art until the day when
    the rival school of the Bellini had become supreme in Venice, and so
    had begun to prepare the way for the triumphs of the Giorgionesque
    period—the golden age of Venetian painting. The <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite>
    (No. 1519), catalogued under the name of Savoldo (1480?–1548?) is by
    Alvise. This magnificent bust-length picture represents Bernardo di
    Salla, who holds in his gloved right hand a paper inscribed “<cite>Dono
    Bnardo di Salla</cite>.” It vividly recalls the <cite>Portrait of a Man with a
    Hawk</cite> at Windsor, which, although it traditionally but erroneously
    bears the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> of Leonardo da Vinci and has been ascribed to Savoldo,
    is in all probability another of the rare portraits by Alvise.</p>

  <p>From the Vivarini group issues Carlo Crivelli (1430?–1493?). His
    morosely ascetic compositions, with their elaborate draperies,
    jewelled ornamentation, and at times grotesque anatomy, distinguish
    his polyptychs, all of which are painted in tempera, from those of any
    other painter in the whole range of art. His large panel picture of
    <cite>St. Bernardino of Siena</cite> (No. 1268) is inscribed</p>

  <div class="center small">OPUS CAROLI CRIVELLI VENETI, 1477.</div>

  <p class="noindent">It belongs to his middle period, and was painted nine years earlier
    than his magnificent <cite>Annunciation</cite>, now one of the gems of the
    National Gallery (No. 739); both these pictures came from the Church of
    the Annunziata at Ascoli.</p>

  <p>Another painter who carried on the Vivarini tradition but was
    influenced by Giovanni Bellini, was Giovanni Battista Cima
    (1460?–1517?), whose art is adequately shown in the <cite>Madonna and Child
    with St. John the Baptist and St. Mary Magdalene</cite> (No. 1259). The
    signature</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">
    IOANIS BAPT.<br />
    CONEGLANES.<br />
    OPVS.</div>

  <p class="noindent">as well as the internal evidence of the picture show it to
    be an authentic work.</p>

  <p>One of the best, but until recent years one of the least known, members
    of that brilliant group of painters who flourished at Venice in the
    early half of the sixteenth century was Lorenzo Lotto (1480–1556).
    He practised his art in many parts of Italy, and for that reason has
    been less generally known than many of his contemporaries. He was a
    pupil of Alvise Vivarini, but benefited largely by the example of
    Giovanni Bellini and Giorgione. His art is not well seen in the small
    <cite>St. Jerome</cite> (No. 1350), which is signed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>and dated “<span class="smcap">lotvs
    1500</span>” and must therefore be one of his earliest and least
    ambitious works, nor in his <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1351) which was formerly
    attributed to Dosso Dossi. Replicas have been found of his <cite>Christ and
    the Woman taken in Adultery</cite> (No. 1349).</p>

  <p>Although we possess very detailed records of Antonello da Messina
    (1430–1479), his movements and his life’s work, it is only in recent
    years that they have been studied with any care. This Sicilian-born
    artist obviously cannot have set out for Flanders and there have learnt
    from Jan van Eyck (who died in 1441) the “discovery” of oil as a
    medium in painting, as Vasari tells us. But he may have seen in Italy
    a picture by the great Northern artist and from it have acquired some
    facility in the use of oil and in finishing with glazes of oil panels
    which had been begun in tempera. He was certainly in Venice in 1475–76,
    if not earlier, and his <cite>Portrait of a Condottiere</cite> (No. 1134, <a href="#i_plate09">Plate
    IX.</a>), which is characteristically signed and dated</p>

    <div class="center">
      <i>1474<br />
      Antonellus Messaneus me<br />
      pinxit</i></div>

  <p class="noindent">belongs to that period of his full maturity. It was
    purchased at the Pourtalès-Gorgier sale in 1865 for £4767. In any case,
    the discoveries with which Antonello is credited within a few years
    completely revolutionised the methods of painting throughout Italy, and
    prepare us for the wonderful achievements of the later Venetians, who
    followed and improved upon the Bellini tradition.</p>

  <p>Vittore Carpaccio (1455?–1526) was, like Gentile Bellini, a painter of
    Venetian fêtes, pageantry, and religious pictures on an imposing scale.
    Nothing is known of Carpaccio’s artistic descent, but his work shows
    traces of the influence of Jacopo Bellini and of Lazzaro Bastiani, who
    was the head of a group of artists whose art was based on the tradition
    of such early painters as Jacobello<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> del Fiore. Carpaccio’s <cite>Preaching
    of St. Stephen at Jerusalem</cite> (No. 1211) is one of the series of five
    incidents from the <cite>Life of St. Stephen</cite> which were painted by this
    artist between 1511 and 1520 for the Scuola di S. Stefano at Milan. The
    others of the series are now in the Milan Gallery (No. 170—signed and
    dated 1513), at Berlin (No. 23), and at Stuttgart. The Louvre obtained
    this canvas, which varies from the others in size, from the Milan
    Gallery in 1813, when together with Boltraffio’s <cite>Madonna of the Casio
    Family</cite> (No. 1169) and other pictures it was exchanged for works by
    Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Dyck, and Jordaens.</p>

  <p>To Vincenzo Catena (14..?–1531?) may be assigned, on stylistic grounds,
    the <cite>Reception of a Venetian Ambassador at Cairo in 1512</cite> (No. 1157).
    In any case, it cannot have been executed by Gentile Bellini, as
    alleged in the Catalogue, as the audience here depicted did not take
    place until five years after that master’s death!</p>

  <p>Another Bellinesque painter was Bartolommeo Veneto (fl. 1505–1555). We
    shall, following the suggestion of Venturi, assign to him the excellent
    but officially unattributed <cite>Portrait of a Lady</cite> (No. 1673) which hangs
    to the right of Raphael’s <cite>La Belle Jardinière</cite>.</p>

  <h3 id="GIORGIONE">GIORGIONE</h3>

  <p>Although a large number of really representative examples of the great
    lyricist Giorgione (1477–1510) have not come down to us, he is to be
    regarded as the greatest of the Venetian artists, and perhaps the most
    romantic painter that Europe has ever known. He was, together with
    his illustrious contemporary Titian, a pupil of Giovanni Bellini. His
    <cite>Pastoral Symphony</cite> (No. 1136, <a href="#i_plate10">Plate X.</a>) is one of the most beautiful
    idyllic groups in the whole range of painting, and shows that Giorgione
    could naively reveal the inner depths of thought and feeling and
    depict “passionate souls in passionate bodies.” Early in the sixteenth
    century the austere traditions of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>Bellinesque era were passing
    away. Giorgione now began to unseal the eyes of his contemporaries,
    among whom Titian occupied an important place, to the “life-giving and
    death-dealing waters of love,” making the landscape background of his
    lyrical compositions respond to the mood of the incident illustrated.
    The <cite>Pastoral Symphony</cite> was acquired by Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span> from
    the collection of the Duke of Mantua; it then passed to Jabach, and
    subsequently to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> Although it has been slightly
    restored and has from time to time been without any reason ascribed to
    Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo and a large number of Venetian artists,
    it is to-day recognised on all sides as an excellent example of
    Giorgione.</p>

    Shepherds with a Female Donor</cite> (No. 1399, <a href="#i_plate11">Plate XI.</a>) is brilliant
    in colour. The signature in the right foreground of this canvas,
    <span class="smcap">tician</span>, is false. Palma left a large number of pictures
    unfinished at his death.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Visitation</cite> (No. 1352) is an admirable example of the art of
    Sebastiano del Piombo (1485–1547), and is signed</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">SEBASTIANVS VENETVS FACIEBAT<br />
    ROMAE MDXXI.</div>

  <p class="noindent">It was purchased in the year indicated in the inscription by François
    <span class="smcap">i.</span>, who added it to his collection at Fontainebleau, whence
    it was removed by Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> to Versailles. The canvas, which
    has been a good deal injured, has at some time been cut into three
    pieces. The name by which this artist is generally known was derived
    from the office which he held late in life at the Papal Court. There he
    forsook the traditions of his native school and gradually came under
    the influence of Michelangelo. In Rome he also met Raphael, who was
    much impressed by his colour schemes: the <cite>St. John the Baptist in the
    Desert</cite> (No. 1500), here catalogued under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> name of Raphael, and a
    few pictures similarly attributed in other galleries, were painted by
    Sebastiano in his Roman manner.</p>

  <p>A prominent place among the less important artists generally included
    in this school must be accorded to Cariani (1480?–1547?). A large
    proportion of the pictures of this Bergamask painter usually pass under
    more imposing names, and it is a remarkable fact that we do not find
    any work attributed to him in the official Catalogue. He, however,
    painted a <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1135), here assigned to Giorgione, as
    well as the <cite>Madonna and Child and St. Sebastian</cite> (No. 1159) given to
    Giovanni Bellini. The <cite>Portrait of Two Men</cite> (No. 1156), which for no
    very apparent reason was once regarded as the portraits of Gentile and
    Giovanni Bellini, must be by Cariani, although still placed to the
    credit of Gentile.</p>

  <p>Another of the less efficient pupils of Giovanni Bellini was Niccolò
    Rondinelli (fl. 1480–1500), whose <cite>Madonna and Child, St. Peter, and
    St. Sebastian</cite> (No. 1158) masquerades as a work by Giovanni Bellini,
    whose full name, <span class="smcap">ioannes bellinvs</span>, is inscribed in capitals
    (not, however, placed in a <i lang="fr">cartellino</i>) on the parapet which runs
    across the front of the panel.</p>

  <h3 id="TITIAN">TITIAN</h3>

  <p>Although we have only limited space to deal with the differences of
    the critics as to the probable date of Titian’s birth, we may point
    out that it was, until recent times, placed in the year 1477. Mr.
    Herbert Cook has, however, put forward a very strong case in favour
    of the year 1489, pointing out the remarkable fact that there is no
    record of Titian earlier than Dec. 2, 1511, or, according to the usual
    chronology, until he was thirty-five years of age! Again, L. Dolce, in
    1557, wrote that Titian was “scarcely twenty years old when Giorgione
    was painting the façade of the Fondaco de’ Tedeschi”; and we know that
    Titian was his assistant on that work in 1507–8. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>Vasari also
    asserts, as Mr. Cook reminds us, that the famous Venetian was “about
    seventy-six years old in 1566–67,” when he visited him in Venice. No
    reliance is to be placed on the date contained in the well-known letter
    which Titian addressed to Philip II. in 1571, as he evidently had a
    motive in referring to himself as “an old servant of ninety-five.”
    There is, however, no doubt that Titian died in 1576.</p>

  <p>Titian, who was a native of Cadore, left his home at an early age
    for Venice. He was first placed as a pupil of Sebastian Zuccato, a
    mosaicist and perhaps a painter; he then seems to have worked in the
    studio of Gentile Bellini before passing into that of Giovanni, where
    he met Giorgione. Titian, like Giotto, has been called “the Father of
    modern painting.” The early Florentine had provided his countrymen
    with a set of fundamental principles of art, but it remained for
    the illustrious Venetian to endow his contemporaries and artistic
    descendants with a more complete equipment and a new sense of pictorial
    effect. The profound impression exerted by Giorgione on the youthful
    Titian inspired him to achieve those idyllic compositions and “poesies”
    which stand out so prominently among the world’s pictures.</p>

  <p>Titian’s earliest picture in the Louvre is the <cite>Virgin and Child,
    with St. Stephen, St. Ambrose, and St. Maurice</cite> (No. 1577), of about
    1508–1510. It is very reminiscent of a picture by Titian in the Vienna
    Gallery (No. 166), in which he has substituted St. Jerome for St.
    Ambrose.</p>

  <p>No doubt can exist as to the authenticity of the so-called <cite>Portrait
    of Alfonso da Ferrara and Laura de’ Dianti</cite> (No. 1590), but the title
    under which it has passed for many years is probably incorrect. It was
    in the collection of Charles I., and was then described as “Tytsian’s
    Mrs., after the life by Tytsian.” In the collection of Jabach it
    was called <cite>La Maîtresse du Titien</cite>, and as such was sold to Louis
    <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> for £100. This picture would correctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> be described
    under the less ambitious title of <cite>A Woman at her Toilet and a Man
    holding Two Mirrors</cite>. Laura was the daughter of a hatter of Ferrara.
    She was <i lang="la">persona grata</i> at the court of Alfonso <span class="smcap">i.</span>, Duke of
    Ferrara (reigned 1505–1534), and there held the title of <i>Illustrissima
    Donna Laura Eustochia d’Este</i>. The Duke’s first wife, Anna Sforza, died
    in 1497, when he was twenty-one years old. In 1501 he married, as his
    second wife, Lucrezia Borgia (died 1519), the natural daughter of Pope
    Alexander <span class="smcap">vi.</span> It seems probable that shortly afterwards the
    Duke took Laura as his third wife, and that she was painted by Titian
    a little later. The Louvre picture (No. 1590) appears on stylistic
    grounds to be a work of about 1515–1517. A portrait which can be more
    certainly identified as that of Laura is the single figure picture,
    painted by Titian about 1523, in the collection of Sir Frederick Cook
    at Richmond.</p>

  <p>The influence of Giorgione is still clearly seen in Titian’s <cite>Man
    with a Glove</cite> (No. 1592, <a href="#i_plate12">Plate XII.</a>). It is a noble portrait of an
    unknown man; the colour is rich, and the light and shade are contrasted
    with great mastery; the bare right hand and the gloved left holding
    the second glove are admirably modelled. The canvas, which seems to
    have been painted about 1518, is signed “<span class="smcap">ticianvs f.</span>” Soon
    afterwards Titian must have painted the <cite>Portrait of a Man in Black
    with the Thumb of his Left Hand in the Belt of his Doublet</cite> (No. 1591),
    the <cite>Madonna with the Rabbit</cite> (No. 1578), which is inscribed <cite>Ticianus
    F.</cite>, and the magnificent <cite>Entombment</cite> (No. 1584, <a href="#i_plate13">Plate XIII.</a>). This
    priceless picture, which was painted not later, than 1523 for Federigo
    Gonzaga, passed from Mantua into the collection of Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>
    It was sold off by Cromwell for £128 and, after being one of the
    masterpieces for a few years in the collection of Jabach, was acquired
    by Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> The deep religious feeling and the rich,
    sonorous harmony of colour make this one of the world’s most precious
    pictures. Notice the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>sunburnt arm of Joseph of Arimathæa; it is
    significant of the art of Venice.</p>

  <p>At an interval of about eight years we come to the <cite>St. Jerome</cite>
    (No. 1585), a religious scene set, curiously enough, in a moonlight
    landscape, which has darkened. The exact interpretation to be placed
    upon the <cite>Allegory in honour of Alfonso d’Avalos</cite> (No. 1589), of about
    1533, has been much discussed; it is supposed to represent Alfonso
    bidding farewell to his wife on his departure for the wars, and
    entrusting her to the safe keeping of Chastity, Cupid, who bears a
    sheaf of arrows, and a third figure. The <cite>Portrait of Francis I.</cite> (No.
    1588), whom Titian never saw, appears to have been painted about 1536
    from a medal, and represents the King in profile. François <span class="smcap">i.</span>
    died in 1547. It belongs to the same period as the <cite>Portrait of a Man
    in Damascened Armour with a Page holding his Helmet</cite> in the collection
    of Count Potocki. Another portrait, painted about 1543, represents a
    <cite>Man with a Black Beard resting his Hand on the Ledge of a Pilaster</cite>
    (No. 1593). By this time Titian’s art was rapidly maturing, as we
    see from his magnificent and imposing <cite>Supper at Emmaus</cite> (No. 1581)
    of the same year. It had passed from Mantua to England before being
    acquired by that excellent connoisseur, Jabach. It is said to be
    signed <i>Ticianus <span class="smcap">f.</span></i>, while the <em>Christ Crowned with Thorns</em>
    (No. 1583), which was painted for a church in Milan about 1550, is
    inscribed <span class="smcap">titianvs <i>f.</i></span> When Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>, as Prince of
    Wales, visited Madrid in 1623, he was presented with the <cite>Jupiter and
    Antiope</cite> (No. 1587), which has the alternative title of the <cite>Venus del
    Pardo</cite>. It had been painted for Philip <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, and had already
    escaped the fire which broke out in the Prado. Jabach acquired it for
    600 guineas, and passed it on to Cardinal Mazarin, from whom it was
    acquired for 10,000 <i lang="fr">livres tournois</i> by Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> It escaped
    destruction by fire in the Old Louvre in 1661. It has been very much
    repainted from time to time.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Madonna and Child, with St. Catherine (? St. Agnes), and St. John
    the Baptist as a Child</cite> (No. 1579), which has been enlarged by the
    addition of a strip of canvas down the left side, contains a glimpse of
    the country near Pieve di Cadore, the native place of Titian. Fourteen
    of the twenty pictures here officially credited to him are to be
    regarded as authentic. Polidoro Lanzani (1515?–1565), an imitator of
    Titian, however, painted the <cite>Holy Family with St. John the Baptist</cite>
    (No. 1580), and the <cite>Holy Family and Saints</cite> (No. 1596) in the La Caze
    Room; while Andrea Meldolla (Schiavone), who was a pupil of Titian,
    no doubt executed the <cite>Ecce Homo</cite> (No. 1582) credited to the great
    Venetian artist, as well as the <cite>St. John the Baptist</cite> (No. 1524) which
    is rightly assigned to him.</p>

  <p>The German painter Johan Stephan von Calcar, who to Italian biographers
    is known as Giovanni Calcar (1499–1546), was a pupil of Titian. He
    painted the imposing <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 1185). He is seen at
    half length standing, and holding a letter in his right hand; his left
    hand to his waist. On a column in the background is painted the coat
    of arms, reputed to be that of the Buono family of Venice, which is
    repeated on the bezel of the ring on the forefinger of his left hand.
    Below his right hand is the inscription:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">ANNO 1540<br />
    ÆTATIS 26.</div>

  <p>Paris Bordone (1500–1570), who “painted women with more of an eye on
    the fashion-plate than on the expression of their features,” is not
    the author of a <cite>Portrait of a Lady</cite> (No. 1180<span class="smcap">a</span>), nor of the
    <cite>Portrait of a Man and a Child</cite> (No. 1180), which seems to be a Flemish
    rather than a Venetian picture. His <cite>Vertumnus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> and Pomona</cite> (No. 1178)
    is less representative than his <cite>Portrait</cite> (so called) <cite>of Jeronimo
    Croft</cite> (No. 1179). It takes its title from the inscription, “<i>Spss.
    Domino Jeronimo Crofft ... Magior suo semper obsero ... Augusta</i>,”
    which is written on the letter held in the right hand.</p>

  <p>The last dying echo of the “fire” and poetry of Giorgione is seen in
    some of the works of Bonifazio Veronese (1487–1553), who was also a
    pupil of Palma. Bonifazio is now regarded as a single individual,
    although formerly the varying differences in his style of painting
    led certain critics to regard him as three different members of the
    same family. The varied grouping seen in the large canvas entitled
    <cite>Holy Family, with St. Francis, St. Anthony, St. Mary Magdalene, St.
    Elizabeth, and St. John the Baptist</cite> (No. 1171), and the colouring
    of this canvas, seem to prove its authenticity. The smaller picture
    of a <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1172), with a similar pedigree and a Greek
    inscription, which includes the same saints, is a mediocre work. The
    <cite>Madonna and Child, with St. Joseph, St. John the Baptist, St. Paul,
    and St. Ursula</cite> (No. 1674<span class="smcap">d</span>) is a poor picture.</p>

  <p>From the studio of Bonifazio issued Jacopo Bassano (1510?–1592), whose
    <cite>Vintage</cite> (No. 1428) shows his predilection for introducing animals and
    kneeling peasants into genre pictures, the treatment of which is apt
    to be rugged. This did not prevent his at times painting striking and
    vigorous portraits. The Louvre contains a good example of this branch
    of his art in the <cite>Portrait of Giovanni da Bologna</cite> (No. 1429), which
    is at present not exhibited. <cite>The Animals entering the Ark</cite> (No. 1423),
    <cite>Moses striking the Rock</cite> (No. 1424), <cite>Cana of Galilee</cite> (No. 1425),
    <cite>Christ bearing His Cross</cite> (No. 1426), and the <cite>Descent from the Cross</cite>
    (No. 1427) are also credited to him in the Catalogue.</p>

  <p>Leandro Bassano (1558–1623), his son, is represented in the La Caze
    collection by an <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite> (No. 1430) and a <cite>Rustic
    Labour</cite> (No. 1431).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

  <p>The vigorous, ambitious and late Venetian painter Tintoretto
    (1518–1594), who painted portrait-groups, religious subjects,
    and mythological compositions on a large scale, and brought his
    achievements to completion with extraordinary rapidity, is not
    adequately represented in this Gallery, in which, however, no fewer
    than eleven works pass under his name. His <cite>Susanna and the Elders</cite>
    (No. 1464) testifies to the increasing frequency with which painters
    or their patrons at that period preferred the representation of
    sensational incidents from the Apocrypha. The subject is unattractive,
    but the picture, which is in a very dirty state, is wonderfully painted.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Paradise</cite> (No. 1465) is but a preliminary sketch for the colossal
    painting, measuring 84 ft. × 34 ft.,—the largest oil-painting by an
    old master in existence,—which Tintoretto painted for the end wall of
    the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Doge’s Palace at Venice. The
    <cite>Portrait of a Man holding a Handkerchief in his Hand</cite> (No. 1467)
    reveals his great power as a portrait painter.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Portrait of Pietro Mocenigo</cite> (No. 1470), signed <span class="smcap">petrus mocenio
    senator</span>, and the <cite>Portrait of a Venetian Senator</cite> (No. 1471),
    inscribed <span class="smcap">anno ætatis lvii mvii iacomo tentoreto . f</span>, are
    among the pictures of the La Caze collection.</p>

  <p>In Room XV., which is given up to self-portraits by artists, hangs a
    picture which passes as an authentic <cite>Portrait of Tintoretto</cite> (No.
    1466) by himself. It is inscribed <span class="smcap">jacobvs tentoretvs pict<sup>or</sup>

  <h3 id="PAOLO_VERONESE">PAOLO VERONESE</h3>

  <p>The harmonious colour, the sense of material magnificence, and the
    masterly draughtsmanship of Paolo Veronese (1528–1588) are seen to the
    greatest advantage in his <cite>Marriage at Cana</cite> (No. 1192). He signed a
    contract in June 1562, to paint this large picture, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>which measures
    21 ft. × 32 ft., for the refectory of San Giorgio Maggiore at Venice,
    and completed it by September 8, 1563. According to the agreement,
    Paolo was to receive 324 ducats, a sum equal to-day to about £200;
    to be fed during the time he was engaged on the work; to be repaid
    the cost of the materials; and to receive a pipe of wine. The picture
    was seized by Napoleon during his victorious campaign of 1797, and
    brought by road to Paris. In accordance with the terms of the Peace of
    Campo Formio of 1814, it should have been returned. As it had proved
    a very difficult matter to take it to Paris, where it had to go into
    the restorer’s hands, the French urged that it was too vast and too
    dilapidated to bear a second journey. Astonishing as it may seem to
    us to-day, the Italians accepted the suggestion and in exchange took
    Charles Le Brun’s large but mediocre <cite>Magdalene at the Feet of Jesus</cite>,
    perhaps because it measured 12 ft. 6 in. × 10 ft. 4 in. Le Brun’s
    picture now hangs in the Venice Gallery (No. 377), the Catalogue of
    which pointedly remarks that “the exchange is much to be regretted.”</p>

  <p>Paolo Veronese’s masterly work contains no devotional feeling. The
    Scriptural story merely serves as a pretext for depicting a scene
    of Venetian festivity and material magnificence with imposing
    architectural background. The grouping of the figures is varied,
    dexterously disposed and stately, while the colour is harmonious and
    sparkling. The changing of the water into wine is, however, merely
    incidental. It is a significant fact that a work of this description,
    in which Art in Venice begins to trick herself out in meretricious
    embellishments, should have been regarded as a seemly decoration for
    the refectory of a convent. An additional but frankly worldly interest
    is imparted to the work by the introduction of a portrait of Alfonso
    d’Avalos (whose portrait by Titian we have already seen) as the
    bridegroom, on the extreme left of the composition; to his left is the
    bride, with the features of Eleonora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> of Austria. The other figures
    include François <span class="smcap">i.</span>, dressed in blue and wearing a curious
    headdress; Mary of England, sister of Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span> and widow
    of Louis <span class="smcap">xii.</span>, in yellow; the Sultan Soliman, in green, at
    the side of a negro prince who addresses a servant. On the left of the
    next figure sits Vittoria Colonna, whom Michelangelo described as “a
    man within a woman,” plying her toothpick! At the end of the table,
    speaking to a servant, is the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">v.</span>, seen in
    profile and wearing the Order of the Golden Fleece. The introduction
    of the fool with the bells in the centre of the picture is perhaps
    intended to express the pomp and pleasure of the world pursued without
    thought of Christ, who, however, occupies the place of honour in the
    centre of the composition. The couple of dogs in leash, one gnawing a
    bone, and a cat, lying on her back as she scratches at one of the vases
    which hold the wine on the right of the composition, may stand for
    merely brutal nature.</p>

  <p>The painter’s personal interest in the scene is depicted in the group
    of four artists in the foreground. Paolo himself is playing a viol;
    just behind him is Tintoretto with a similar instrument; while on the
    right are Titian, in red with a bass viol, and Bassano playing the
    flute. The theory put forward by Mr. Herbert Cook that Titian was born
    as late as 1489, and so would be seventy-four years old in 1562–63,
    the year in which this picture was painted, certainly seems to find
    corroboration in the features here given to Titian by Paolo Veronese.
    He certainly does not look eighty-seven years of age, as he should do
    if he had been born as early as 1476.</p>

  <p>In the Catalogue sixteen pictures are assigned to Paolo Veronese.
    The <cite>Portrait of a Lady and a Child playing with a Dog</cite> (No. 1199)
    is an early work. The <cite>Disciples at Emmaus</cite> (No. 1196), which is
    signed “<span class="smcap">paolo veronese</span>,” is another of the master’s imposing
    canvases, as also is the <cite>Feast in the House of Simon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> Pharisee</cite>
    (No. 1193), which was presented to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> by the Venetian
    Republic in 1665, and was for many years hung at Versailles. This
    artist is also officially credited with the <cite>Burning of Sodom</cite> (No.
    1187), a <cite>Holy Family, with St. George, St. Catherine, and a Male
    Donor</cite> (No. 1190), a <cite>Holy Family, with St. Elizabeth and St. Mary
    Magdalene, and a Female Donor</cite> (No. 1191), a <cite>Christ heeding Peter’s
    Wife’s Mother</cite> (No. 1191<span class="smcap">a</span>), a <cite>Christ fainting under the
    weight of the Cross</cite> (No. 1194), a <cite>Calvary</cite> (No. 1195), and an <cite>Esther
    fainting before Ahasuerus</cite> (No. 1189). The <cite>Susan and the Elders</cite>
    (No. 1188) is a replica of a picture in the collection of the Duke of
    Devonshire. The <cite>St. Mark crowning the Theological Virtues</cite> (No. 1197),
    and the <cite>Jupiter hurling Thunderbolts on Criminals</cite> (No. 1198), were
    originally executed as ceiling paintings for the Doge’s Palace. The
    <cite>Christ with the Terrestrial Globe</cite> (No. 1200) and the <cite>Portrait of a
    Lady in Black</cite> (No. 1201) are only studio pictures.</p>

  <p>Little artistic ability is shown in the empty abstractions, and
    at times meaningless productions, of many of the late sixteenth,
    seventeenth, and eighteenth century Venetian artists. Felice Riccio
    (Il Brusasorci the Younger) (1540–1605) is given as the painter of a
    <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1463); Alessandro Turchi (Orbetto) (1582–1648) of
    three pictures (Nos. 1558–1560); Sebastiano Ricci (1659?–1734) of four
    compositions (Nos. 1458–1461); Antonio Pellegrino (1675–1741) of an
    <cite>Allegory</cite> (No. 1413); Alessandro Varotari (1590–1650) of an utterly
    uninspired <cite>Venus and Cupid</cite> (No. 1574); and Pietro della Vecchia
    (1605–1678) of a dull <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 1576).</p>

  <p>A century later than the stupendous achievements of Tintoretto and
    Veronese the art of Venice had passed into decline, but a glimmer of
    the genius that had found expression in the gorgeously decorative art
    in Venice in the sixteenth century was yet to be reflected in the
    work of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (1692–1769). His <cite>Last Supper</cite> (No.
    1547) was purchased for £400 in 1877, and his sketch for the <cite>Triumph
    of Religion</cite> (No. 1549<span class="smcap">a</span>) for £1200<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> in 1903. By him also is
    the <cite>Banner</cite> (No. 1549), depicting on the one side <cite>St. Martin saying
    Mass</cite>, and on the other <cite>The Madonna and Child</cite>. An <cite>Apparition of the
    Virgin to St. Jerome</cite> (No. 1548) is one of the less striking pictures
    in the La Caze collection.</p>

  <p>Another decorative painter was Antonio Canale, generally known as
    Canaletto (1697–1768), who is well represented in the <cite>View of the
    Church of Santa Maria della Salute and the Grand Canal</cite> (No. 1203). The
    Louvre appears to contain nothing by Bernardo Bellotto (1720–1780),
    who is sometimes referred to as Canaletto, and is seen to the best
    advantage at Dresden.</p>

  <p>Canaletto’s pupil, Francesco Guardi (1712–1793), who was born of
    Austrian parentage, is the painter of seven Venetian scenes: <cite>After
    wedding the Adriatic, the Doge embarks at the Lido on the “Bucentaur”</cite>
    (No. 1328); <cite>The Doge proceeds to S. Maria della Salute to commemorate
    the Preservation of Venice from the Plague in 1630</cite> (No. 1329); <cite>Fête
    du Jeudi Gras in the Piazzetta</cite> (No. 1330); <cite>The Procession of Corpus
    Domini in the Piazza of S. Marco</cite> (No. 1331); <cite>The Visit of the Doge to
    the Church of S. Zaccharia on Easter Day</cite> (No. 1332); <cite>The Doge seated
    on his Throne in the Sala del Collegio</cite> (No. 1333); <cite>Coronation of the
    Doge</cite> (No. 1334); and a <cite>View of the Church of S. Maria della Salute</cite>
    (No. 1335). Guardi’s pupil, François Casanova (1739–1805), a painter of
    battle-pieces, worked in France; some of his pictures are hung in the
    French Rooms.</p>

  <p>With Guardi we close the chapter of Venetian art which, owing to four
    centuries of high aspiration and magnificent achievement, came to an
    end later than the art of any other school of painting in Italy.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">FAR-REACHING influences were to be exerted by classical Padua on the
    art of the neighbouring cities of Northern Italy. Padua was a city of
    great antiquity, and had been sufficiently powerful and prosperous
    even in Roman times to excite the cupidity of its enemies. Eventually
    the Goths and other barbarian hordes had destroyed its monuments of
    the Roman age; the spirit of antiquity, nevertheless, survived until
    Giotto came at the very beginning of the fourteenth century to decorate
    the walls of the Chapel of the Madonna dell’ Arena, which had been
    founded in 1303 by Enrico Scrovegno on the site of an ancient Roman
    arena. These very precious frescoes by Giotto, which fortunately are
    still preserved, revolutionised art, and the movement initiated by him
    quickened the art-life of this University city.</p>

  <p>Half a century later, Altichiero Altichieri (fl. 1320–1385) developed
    his art under the influence of Giotto, and beautified the churches
    of Padua with frescoes, the figures in which he clothed in fanciful
    attire. An art movement was now on foot, and the influence of
    altichieri, who was later to become the founder of the school of
    Verona, was to be revealed in the work of his follower Pisanello, the
    Veronese painter and medallist.</p>

  <p>The long residence in Padua of Donatello (1386–1466), the great
    Florentine sculptor, and the erection of his famous equestrian statue
    of Gattamelata initiated in Padua the Renaissance movement, which
    soon took deep root in this ancient city. The example of Donatello in
    sculpture before long brought about the foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> of a local school
    of painting which was rapidly developed through the shrewd commonsense
    rather than the artistic achievements of Francesco Squarcione
    (1394–1474). It is noteworthy that Squarcione had travelled in the
    East, and had there formed a collection of antique works of plastic art
    which became the basis of his art-teaching.</p>

  <p>One of the numerous pupils of Squarcione was Gregorio Schiavone (“The
    Slavonian”) (fl. 1440–1470), a native of Dalmatia, who in the studio
    of his Paduan master met Andrea Mantegna. The Louvre authorities with
    some hesitancy attribute to Schiavone a <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1523).
    although it is hardly by him, it exhibits some of the characteristics
    of Schiavone, who was fond of decorating his pictures with festoons of
    flowers and fruit in much the same way that his Venetian contemporary,
    Carlo Crivelli, delighted to adorn his large panel pictures.</p>

  <h3 id="ANDREA_MANTEGNA">ANDREA MANTEGNA</h3>

  <p>Andrea Mantegna (1431–1506) was adopted at the age of ten by
    Squarcione, and so naturally became his pupil. No better training
    could have been chosen for the boy, who had a natural taste for the
    classics, proof of which is further afforded by the Latin inscriptions
    on his pictures. Andrea seems to have quickly realised the connection
    between the traditions of Paduan antiquities and the classical models
    of ancient Greece which his adoptive father Squarcione had brought home
    with him from his travels. Andrea in time became deeply impressed with
    the methods of Jacopo Bellini, whose daughter Niccolosia he married
    in 1453, to the great displeasure of Squarcione. Another powerful
    influence on Mantegna may be traced to the bronzes which Donatello
    executed for the Church of Sant’ Antonio of Padua in that city.</p>

  <p>After painting the frescoes in the Church of the Eremitani at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>Padua, Andrea in 1457 executed a large and striking altarpiece for
    the Church of San Zeno in Verona. It was removed by Napoleon’s agents
    to France in 1797, but only the principal panel was returned to that
    church in 1815. The three predella panels were retained in France. The
    centre one of these, depicting the <cite>Calvary</cite>, is now in the Louvre (No.
    1373); the other two, representing the <cite>Agony in the Garden</cite> and the
    <cite>Resurrection</cite>, have long hung in the Museum at Tours. The severity of
    the statuesque figures and the certainty of the drawing seen in the
    <cite>Calvary</cite> are characteristic of the early period of the master.</p>

  <p>Mantegna now removed to Mantua, where he entered the service of
    Lodovico <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, Marquis of Mantua, as his Court Painter,
    remaining there for the rest of his life. The <cite>Madonna of Victory</cite>
    (No. 1374) was painted to commemorate the victory gained at the
    Pass of Fornovo on the Taro on July 6, 1495, by Giovanni Francesco
    <span class="smcap">iii.</span>, Marquis of Mantua, over Charles <span class="smcap">viii.</span> of
    France. In the centre of the picture the Madonna and Child are
    enthroned. On the left kneels the Marquis, and on the right is St.
    Elizabeth, the patron saint of Gonzaga’s wife, Isabella d’Este, “at the
    sound of whose name all the Muses rise and do reverence.” St. Michael
    standing behind the Duke, and St. George behind St. Elizabeth, hold
    the robe of the Madonna, who is thus represented as taking under her
    protection the two principal figures. In the background on the left is
    St. Andrew, name-saint of the painter and one of the patrons of Mantua.
    On the right is St. Longinus with the spear with which he pierced
    the side of Christ. His relics were preserved in the Church of St.
    Andrea in Mantua. The garlands of flowers and festoons of fruit are a
    well-known device in Mantegna’s pictures.</p>

  <p>Mantegna’s <cite>Parnassus</cite> (No. 1375, <a href="#i_plate14">Plate XIV.</a>) illustrates the <i lang="fr">amours</i>
    of Mars and Venus, which were discovered by her husband, Vulcan. In
    the foreground the Muses are dancing. The group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> the Muses was
    afterwards appropriated by Giulio Romano for his <cite>Dance of Apollo
    and the Muses</cite> in the Pitti Palace at Florence. This painting was
    executed in 1497, just before the coming of the Renaissance feeling
    into Venetian art and the representation of classical myth. Notice the
    excellently drawn and highly characteristic shells and stones placed
    in the foreground. In the same year Mantegna painted the <cite>Triumph of
    Wisdom and Virtue over the Vices</cite> (No. 1376), the last of the four
    pictures by him in this Gallery. In the corner to the extreme left is
    Virtus Deserta, who appears under the guise of a laurel tree with a
    woman’s head; about the stem is wound a scroll with inscriptions in
    Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. The Latin inscription reads:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">
    AGITE PELLITE SEDIBUS NOSTRIS<br />
    FAEDA HAEC VICIORV̄ MONSTRA<br />
    VIRTUTVM COELITVS AD NOS REDEV̄TIVM</div>

  <p class="noindent">and on the inside of the scroll:</p>

  <div class="center small">DIVAE COMITES.</div>

  <p class="noindent">This painting formerly decorated the <i lang="it">camerino</i> of Isabella d’Este at
    Mantua. It was seized at the sack of Mantua by Cardinal Richelieu in
    1630, together with the <cite>Parnassus</cite> (No. 1375), Perugino’s <cite>Combat of
    Love and Chastity</cite> (No. 1567), and Lorenzo Costa’s <cite>Court of Isabella
    d’Este</cite> (No. 1261). <cite>The Mythological Scene</cite> (No. 1262), which is not
    now exhibited, represents the <cite>Realm of Erotic Love</cite>; it was begun by
    Mantegna the year he died, and was gone over and completed by Lorenzo
    Costa.</p>

  <p>Mantegna became involved financially towards the end of his life, and
    the collection he had formed was sold. His last years were clouded by
    pecuniary embarrassment. His compositions are essentially classic in
    spirit, his figures noble and painted in imitation of the antique,
    while his pagan conceptions prepared the way for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> those of a later
    generation in the art of Venice. By this process of gradual evolution
    the school of Padua came to be distinguished among the other local
    schools of Northern Italy in the lifetime of Mantegna, whose example
    gave a new impulse to contemporary art.</p>

  <p>A small <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite> (No. 1678), which is officially
    unattributed, is regarded by Mr. Berenson as the work of Bernardo
    Parenzano (1437–1531), who was influenced by Mantegna, and imitated the
    methods of his contemporaries.</p>

  <p>Many other artists bore their part in the work of this school, and
    so contributed to the development of this movement which spread to
    Veronese and Venetian territory. They are, however, unrepresented in
    the Louvre. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_VERONA">THE SCHOOL OF VERONA</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE foundations of the art of Verona were laid in Paduan soil by
    altichieri, who initiated the school of Verona. Veronese art early
    found expression in the naive pictorial and mediæval style practised
    by the medallist-painter Antonio Pisanello (1397–1455), whose name
    appears to have been an endearing diminutive. He was a follower, if
    not a pupil, of Altichieri. The frequency with which he signed himself
    “<span class="smcap">pictor</span>” on his medals leads one to suppose that he looked
    upon himself as a painter first and foremost, and contemporary records
    seem to confirm this. His art was so highly reputed in Northern Italy
    that the Venetians thought it advisable to invite him to Venice in 1421
    to assist Gentile da Fabriano in painting frescoes, now destroyed, in
    the Doge’s Palace.</p>

  <p>Jacopo Bellini also worked at Verona. He is known to have painted
    a picture of the <cite>Crucifixion</cite> for the Chapel of S. Niccolò in the
    Cathedral at Verona in 1436, but, after exercising considerable
    influence on the art of Northern Italy, it was in 1759 hewn down by a
    Canon with a view to beautifying the chapel!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there are only two frescoes from the hand of Pisanello
    at Verona, while no more than four authentic easel paintings by him
    are known to exist, two of them being in the National Gallery. He is
    known to have travelled extensively in Italy, and to have worked also
    at Mantua, Ferrara, and Rimini. The traditions of mediæval chivalry and
    the pictorial parade of pomp and mundane realism which are reflected in
    his work show that his contemporaries were justified in the high esteem
    in which they held him.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

  <p>Pisanello’s love of depicting birds and animals is shown in his two
    pictures in the National Gallery, but in the <cite>Portrait of a Princess of
    the Este Family</cite> (No. 1422<span class="smcap">a</span>, or No. 1422 <i>Bis</i>) he is shown
    to have been a lover of flowers also. This small panel was formerly
    attributed to Piero dei Franceschi, the Umbrian artist. For many years
    it hung among the Drawings, being apparently considered unworthy of a
    place in its proper environment, among the Italian primitive paintings,
    where it is now hung. It was purchased in 1893 out of the Felix Bamberg
    collection. The lady is seen in profile to the left. Her hair is
    dressed according to the fashion of the period, the front hair being
    plucked out to render the forehead round and high, while the nape of
    her neck for the same reason is hairless. She wears a white dress with
    loose-falling red sleeves; a sprig of juniper (<i>ginevra</i>) is let into
    her dress just above the left shoulder. It has been assumed from this
    that we here have a <cite>Portrait of Ginevra d’Este</cite>. She was the daughter
    of Niccolò <span class="smcap">ii.</span> d’Este by his second wife, the infamous and
    ill-treated Parisina Malatesta, who was decapitated in 1425. Ginevra
    (1419–1440) became the wife of Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, in
    1433, and died three years later. The background is composed of pinks
    and columbines, among which fly four highly decorative butterflies.
    The embroidery on the left sleeve of the dress is patterned with the
    <i>impresa</i> of a crystal vase set round with pearls. It is interesting
    to note that Ginevra’s husband, Sigismondo, is probably the Donor in
    the <cite>Madonna and Child and a Kneeling Donor</cite> (No. 1159<span class="smcap">a</span> or No.
    1279) by Jacopo Bellini which hangs next to it on the left. The only
    other painted portrait by Pisanello known is the later, and larger, one
    of Leonello d’Este in the Bergamo Gallery.</p>

  <p>Bono da Ferrara (fl. 1450–1461) was a pupil of Pisanello, and Oriolo
    (fl. 1450) was a follower of his; their pictures are extremely rare.
    The Louvre contains no picture by Liberale da Verona (1451–1536),
    a master who had many pupils, among whom may be included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> Girolamo
    dai Libri (1474–1556) and Francesco Caroto (1470–1546). The <cite>Madonna
    and Child and St. John the Baptist</cite> (No. 1318), which is officially
    catalogued under the name of Girolamo, has long been held to be by
    Caroto.</p>

  <p>Domenico Brusasorci (“The Rat-burner”) (1494–1567) was the father of
    Felice Riccio and a pupil of Caroto. He has been claimed as the author
    of the <cite>Madonna and St. Martina</cite> (No. 1163), which passes in the
    Catalogue as being by the very late Roman painter Pietro Berretini da
    Cortona (1596–1669). Other versions of this composition, representing
    St. Martina triumphing over the Idols, are known. A large number of the
    prominent Veronese painters are unrepresented in this collection, but
    the influence of Liberale is frequently seen. The <cite>Council of Trent</cite>
    (No. 1586) may be assigned to Paolo Farinati, although it is regarded
    by the authorities as coming from the hand of Titian. By the time that
    Farinati died, art in Verona had passed into decline.</p>

  <p>One of the most decorative painters in Italy in the sixteenth century
    was Paolo Veronese, who although a native of Verona spent the best
    years of his life in Venice. He is usually included among the artists
    of Venice. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_FERRARA">THE SCHOOL OF FERRARA</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ACCORDING to tradition the most famous artist in the school of Ferrara
    before Tura was Ettore de’ Bonacossi, of whom little is known.</p>

  <p>At Ferrara, the city of the Este family, as at all the Italian courts,
    the art of painting was liberally patronised. All Ferrarese art was
    more or less Paduan both in origin and style, Cosimo Tura (1430?–1495),
    the founder of this school, having worked at Padua as a pupil of
    Squarcione.</p>

  <p>The seriousness of Cosimo Tura’s realism was unyielding to those
    intellectual qualities that dominated the art of Florence in his
    day; but, in spite of a certain harshness of effect, the vigour of
    his design and the dignity of his conception give permanent value to
    the work of this master. Tura is represented in the Louvre by two
    pictures; the figures seen in his large lunette of the <cite>Pietà</cite> (No.
    1556) are admirably designed to fill up the space they occupy. This
    panel is a dismembered part of an altarpiece which was painted for
    the Roverella family, and was formerly in its entirety in the Church
    of S. Giorgio fuori le Mura at Ferrara. The <cite>Pietà</cite> eventually passed
    to the Campana collection, and so to the Louvre. The drapery in this
    panel, which is cracked horizontally, is tinny, and the flesh is
    metallic with its white and purple lights, while the bones in the
    faces being over-prominent create an unpleasant effect. The centre
    panel of the original altarpiece represents the <cite>Madonna and Child
    Enthroned</cite>. It passed in time into the Frizzoni collection at Bergamo,
    and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> subsequently purchased in 1867 from Sir Charles Eastlake for
    the National Gallery (No. 772). The sinister wing of the original
    altarpiece depicts the <cite>Bishop Lorenzo Roverella presented to the
    Virgin by St. Maurelius and St. Paul</cite>, and is now in the private rooms
    of the Colonna Palace in Rome.</p>

  <p>The Church of S. Giorgio fuori le Mura at Ferrara also at one time
    contained another altarpiece painted by Cosimo Tura. It was placed
    over the altar of St. Maurelius, but has long ago been dismembered.
    One of its panels is the <cite>Flight into Egypt</cite>, in the collection of
    Mr. R. H. Benson; two others, representing a <cite>Scene from the Life
    of St. Maurelius</cite> and <cite>The Martyrdom of St. Maurelius</cite>, are in the
    Ferrara Gallery; another is the <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite>, in the
    possession of the Contessa di Santa Fiora, in Rome; while a fifth, the
    <cite>Circumcision</cite>, belongs to the Marchesa Passeri, in Rome.</p>

  <p>The Louvre possesses an arched panel of <cite>A Monk</cite> (No. 1557) by Tura.
    The panel is split and the cheek of the saint injured.</p>

  <p>The seriousness of purpose which inspired Cosimo Tura was absorbed by
    his pupil Francesco Cossa (1435–1477), whose art is not seen at the
    Louvre. One of Cossa’s pupils was Lorenzo Costa, who in 1483 passed
    from Ferrara to Bologna, to which city he carried the principles of
    Tura’s training. Francesco Bianchi (1460–1510) was another of Tura’s
    pupils, but he belongs more strictly to the school of Modena. Another
    pupil in the studio of the <i lang="fr">chef d’ecole</i> of Ferrarese painting was
    Ercole Roberti (1430?–1496), who also worked at Padua. This painter,
    whose full name was Ercole de’ Roberti Grandi, has been justly claimed
    as the author of the two small panels representing <cite>St. Apollonia</cite>
    (No. 1677<span class="smcap">a</span>), holding in her hand the pincers, the symbol of
    her martyrdom, and <cite>St. Michael</cite> (No. 1677<span class="smcap">b</span>). These companion
    pictures are officially described under the ambiguous designation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
    “Ferrarese School, <span class="smcap">xvi</span> century.” They, however, clearly belong
    to the earlier century, and are probably by Roberti.</p>

  <p>The Louvre contains nothing by Ercole Roberti’s pupil, Ercole di Giulio
    Cesare Grandi (1465?–1531). Ercole Grandi’s influence is sometimes seen
    in the exceedingly rare pictures of Giovanni Battista Benvenuto, who is
    better known under the name of Ortolano (“the gardener”), and takes his
    name from the occupation of his father. The art of Ortolano (1460–1529)
    is seen to the greatest advantage in the <cite>St. Sebastian, St. Roch, and
    St. Demetrius</cite>, in the National Gallery (No. 669). An immature work by
    him is apparently the <cite>Nativity</cite> in this Gallery (No. 1401), which in
    the opinion of the compilers of the Catalogue is by Domenico Panetti
    (1450?–1512?), a pupil of Lorenzo Costa. Panetti’s works are rarely met
    with out of Italy.</p>

  <p>Among the pictures of this school, those of Lodovico Mazzolino
    (1478?–1528) are perhaps the easiest to recognise. His <cite>Holy Family</cite>
    (No. 1387) is not now exhibited, but the <cite>Christ preaching to the
    Multitude on the Sea of Galilee</cite> (No. 1388) is evidently by him,
    although it has been ranked by one critic as a Flemish picture painted
    under the inspiration of Mazzolino and Dosso Dossi.</p>

  <p>Panetti was the master of Benvenuto Tisi, a very prolific painter who
    is better known by the name of Garofalo (1481?–1559), owing to his
    occasionally painting a gillyflower into his pictures as a signature.
    although the Catalogue includes four small works by this artist, a
    <cite>Circumcision</cite> (No. 1550), a <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1552), a <cite>Madonna and
    Child</cite> (No. 1554), and a <cite>Sleeping Child Jesus</cite> (No. 1553), only the
    last of them is now exhibited.</p>

  <p>Another artist in this school who signed his pictures with a <i>rebus</i>
    was Giovanni Lutero (1479?–1542), who is better known under the name
    of Dosso Dossi. A typical instance of this punning use of his name is
    the <cite>Money Changers driven out of the Temple</cite>, in the Doria Gallery at
    Rome; it is signed with a “D”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> traversed by a bone (<i>osso</i>), obviously
    a play on his name of Dosso or D OSSO. No picture by Dosso Dossi is now
    exhibited.</p>

  <p>Francesco Bonsignori (1455–1519), Marco Zoppo (fl. 1471–1498), Michele
    Coltellini (1480–1542), Ippolito Scarsellino (1551–1620), Girolamo
    da Carpi, and other Ferrarese painters are unrepresented in this
    collection.</p>

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_MILAN">THE SCHOOL OF MILAN</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE painters who practised in Milan in the fourteenth century were
    little better than provincial craftsmen who had come within the range
    of the Giottesque tradition without grasping the more vital of its
    principles. Those who worked in Milanese territory in the first half of
    the fifteenth century acquired some of the reflected influences which
    passed from the work of Pisanello and Jacopo Bellini in Verona, and
    from the more striking achievements of the Paduan and early Venetian
    schools, but their work lacked all trace of originality.</p>

  <p>A painter of the name of Michelino Molinari da Besozzo (fl. 1394–1442),
    or Michele da Pavia, was painting at Milan about 1420. However,
    there cannot be said to have been a school of painting, but only an
    aggregation of painters in Milanese territory, prior to the arrival at
    Pavia and Milan of the Brescian-born master, Vicenzo Foppa, about 1458.
    Previous to that important event, if not throughout the whole range of
    its activity, Milanese art lacked the higher elements of genius in all
    matters æsthetic. As a school it was to the end too inclined to mere
    prettiness and superficial sweetness.</p>

  <p>The Umbrian-born architect and painter, Bramante (1444–1514), who had
    received his education in Florence, painted in Lombardy from 1472–1474,
    as his Panigarola frescoes now in the Brera testify. Bramante also
    influenced Foppa, whose work is well defined and whose colouring is
    subdued.</p>

  <p>Side by side with Foppa at the head of the Milanese school comes
    Bernardino Butinone (fl. 1450–1507), a great deal of whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> work may
    still be seen at Milan. A <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1523), which is
    doubtfully ascribed in the Catalogue to Gregorio Schiavone, a pupil of
    Squarcione at Padua, may possibly be by Butinone, whose art is marked
    by an austerity and dryness which are absent from the paintings of
    Zenale, who was the partner and perhaps a pupil of Butinone.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Circumcision, with the Portrait of the Donor</cite> (No. 1545), although
    catalogued under the name of Bramantino, may be by Zenale (1436–1526).
    This panel is inscribed “<span class="smcap">xl. anno 1491. f͞r] i͞a lapugnanvs p͞p
    hvmil can̄.</span>” Bramantino (1455?–1536?), whose name was Bartolommeo
    Suardi, came under the influence of Foppa and Bramante, and from the
    latter acquired his <i lang="fr">sobriquet</i>.</p>

  <p>The pictures of Borgognone (1455?–1522?) are easily recognised
    by the ashen grey pallor of his faces, relieved occasionally by
    eyelids reddened by grief. He was a prolific painter of religious
    pictures which show simple pathos. With the possible exception of
    the <cite>Family Portraits</cite> in the National Gallery (Nos. 779–780), which
    are indeed fragments of a standard, and may have been painted by
    Zenale, Borgognone, whose name was Ambrogio da Fossano, is not known
    to have painted a secular subject. This typical Milanese painter
    was another of the pupils of Foppa. Being an architect as well as a
    painter, Borgognone delighted in giving an architectural setting to
    his compositions. He also loved to introduce brightly coloured carpets
    and draperies, and minutely painted jewellery into his pictures. These
    characteristics are seen in his companion pictures of <cite>St. Peter Martyr
    and a Donoress</cite> (No. 1182), and <cite>St. Augustine and a kneeling Donor</cite>
    (No. 1182<span class="smcap">a</span>). The latter of this pair of panels of his early
    period was purchased from Lord Aldenham in 1899 for 1000 guineas. They
    originally formed part of a dismembered altarpiece, the centre panel
    of which is now lost or unidentified. His <cite>Presentation of Christ in
    the Temple</cite> (No. 1181), although originally painted on panel, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
    transferred to canvas in 1885. Borgognone might almost be termed the
    Perugino of the Milanese school.</p>

  <h3 id="ANDREA_SOLARIO">ANDREA SOLARIO</h3>

  <p>Andrea Solario (1460?–1515?), who was perhaps the pupil of his brother
    Cristoforo a sculptor and architect, went with him to Venice in 1490
    and remained there at least three years. During this time he came under
    the influence of Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. Earlier in his
    career he was impressed by the pictures of Antonello da Messina, who
    was in Venice and Milan in 1475–1476. Solario can hardly have become
    Antonello’s pupil at that early age. He must also have come within the
    sphere of Leonardo da Vinci’s influence. Leonardo, who worked in Milan
    between 1482 and 1500 and from 1506 to 1513, was asked by the Cardinal
    George of Amboise to decorate a chapel in the Château at Gaillon in
    Normandy. He, however, advised the Cardinal to employ Solario. Solario
    in consequence went to France in August 1507 to undertake the work.
    The Louvre is rich in his pictures. His charming <cite>Madonna of the Green
    Cushion</cite> (No. 1530) is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Andreas de Solario fa.</i></div>

  <p class="noindent">This small panel was once the property of Marie de Médicis. The
    <cite>Crucifixion</cite> (No. 1532) was formerly catalogued under the name of
    Andrea de Milan, which led some to confuse Andrea Solario with the much
    less efficient painter, Andrea Salaino. This picture is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small">ANDREAS MEDIOLANENSIS FA 1503,</div>

  <p class="noindent">a form of signature which is said to have been employed by Solario only
    for such of his pictures as were destined for other towns than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> Milan.
    The <cite>Head of St. John the Baptist on a Charger</cite> (No. 1533) is said to
    be signed and dated</p>

    <div class="center small">ANDREAS DE SOLARIO, FAT, 1507.</div>

  <p>The <cite>Portrait of Charles d’Amboise, Seigneur of Chaumont and Governor
    of Milan</cite> (No. 1531), like many other of Solario’s pictures, has in
    the past, when the range of his art was not so well understood, been
    attributed to other artists.</p>

  <h3 id="BERNARDINO_LUINI">BERNARDINO LUINI</h3>

  <p>In Bernardino Luini (1475?–1533?) we have a lyrical artist. He is said
    to have been a pupil of one Stefano Scotto, but he was deeply impressed
    by the art of Borgognone, and early in the sixteenth century came under
    the influence of Leonardo. Indeed, it was almost impossible at that
    period of Milanese art for a painter in that school to resist the style
    of Leonardo. Although Luini’s works are reminiscent of the greater
    master, he strove after originality; he was an industrious painter
    rather than an artist of genius. Luini is never very emotional, never
    passionate, never dramatic. His figures are characterised by sweetness
    and grace; his types are refined but insipid and are apt to become
    monotonous. It is as a painter of frescoes that he succeeds best, and
    the Louvre is fortunate in possessing several of his works in that
    medium. The best are a <cite>Nativity</cite> (No. 1359), and an <cite>Adoration of the
    Magi</cite> (No. 1360). The <cite>Head of Christ</cite> (No. 1361) is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">POSCE NE DUBITA QUOD<br />
    QUODCV̄ PATRI IN NOMINE ME<sup>o</sup><br />
    PETIERIS FIET TIBI.</div>

  <p>They were acquired in 1867 from the collection of the Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> Antonio
    Litta Visconti Arese, of Milan. The Louvre also contains fragments of
    large fresco paintings of the <cite>Forge of Vulcan</cite> (No. 1356), a <cite>Child
    Seated</cite> (No. 1357), and a <cite>Child Kneeling</cite> (No. 1358). They form part
    of the series, which is now preserved in Milan, but formerly decorated
    the Villa Pelucca near Monza; they were removed from there in 1817.
    These three fragments have been transferred from plaster to canvas or
    panel. The four frescoes (Nos. 1362–1365) are by a pupil. The art of
    Luini as a painter on panel is seen to advantage in the <cite>Holy Family</cite>
    (No. 1353), the <cite>Virgin and the Infant Christ</cite> (No. 1354), and <cite>Salome
    receiving the Head of St. John the Baptist</cite> (No. 1355).</p>

  <p>The arrival of Leonardo da Vinci, when little over thirty years of age,
    at the court of Lodovico Sforza at Milan revolutionised art in that
    city. The exquisite rhythm and balance and the remarkable gestures and
    facial expression seen in his <cite>Last Supper</cite> must have made a profound
    impression on all the Milanese, people and painters alike. Not having
    been educated in the profound principles that gradually built up the
    school of Florence, whence the great painter came, the majority of the
    native artists were so overcome by his power that in time they became
    enslaved by the magic of his brush.</p>

  <p>Ambrogio da Predis (1455?–1506?), who worked as Leonardo’s assistant
    on the National Gallery’s replica of the <cite>Virgin of the Rocks</cite> in this
    collection (No. 1599), is not represented here. Another assistant
    and pupil of Leonardo was Bernardino de’ Conti. As we have seen, he
    may be the painter of the <cite>Profile Portrait of a Lady</cite>—or <cite>La Belle
    Ferronnière</cite> (No. 1605)—which is officially regarded as being of the
    “School of Leonardo.” A similar attribution is also given to the
    <cite>Madonna of the Scales</cite> (No. 1604), which should rather be assigned
    to Cesare da Sesto (1477–1523), a sickly and insipid imitator of
    the master. Another of Leonardo’s imitators was Marco d’Oggiono
    (1470?–1540). His copy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> Leonardo’s <cite>Last Supper</cite> (No. 1603) is
    perhaps of greater interest than his own <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1382) and
    <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1382<span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

  <p>One of the more original of the imitators of Leonardo was Boltraffio
    (1467–1516), whose <cite>Madonna of the Casio Family</cite> (No. 1169) was
    formerly in the Milan Gallery, where any picture containing a portrait
    of that poet might reasonably have been expected to remain. This
    picture is the painter’s masterpiece.</p>

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_LOMBARDY">THE SCHOOL OF LOMBARDY</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AFTER the activity which had prevailed in Milan during the last half of
    the fifteenth century and the first quarter of the sixteenth century,
    art in Lombardy rapidly deteriorated. Before the decline had passed
    into decadence Pier Francesco Sacchi (fl. 1512–1527) painted at Pavia
    his <cite>Four Doctors of the Church</cite> (No. 1488), which is signed in the
    cartouche</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">PETRI FRANCISCI<br />
    SACHI DE PAPIA<br />
    OPUS 1516.</div>

  <p class="noindent">Each of the Doctors duplicates the part of an Evangelist. On the left
    St. Augustine, with his book inscribed “De Civitate Dei,” is also shown
    as St. John with his eagle; St. Gregory, with his dove, is also St.
    Luke with his bull; St. Jerome, with his cardinal’s hat, is also St.
    Matthew with his angel; while St. Ambrose, with his scourge, is also
    St. Mark with his lion. The scourge held by St. Ambrose, a patron saint
    of Milan, alludes to his refusing the Emperor Theodosius admittance
    into the church at Milan in consequence of the general massacre he
    ordered with a view to subduing a sedition at Thessalonica in A.D. 390.</p>

  <p>Another early-sixteenth-century Pavian painter was Bartolommeo Bononi,
    whose only known picture is the <cite>Madonna and Child, St. Francis, a
    Bishop, and a Monk</cite> (No. 1174). It is signed</p>

  <div class="center small">OPUS BARTOLOMEI BONONII CIVIS PAPIENSIS 1501.</div>

  <p class="noindent">on the stump of the tree in the centre foreground.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

  <p>A striking, although mediocre, <cite>Family of the Virgin</cite> (No. 1284) by
    Lorenzo de’ Fasoli, who is also known as Lorenzo di Pavia, and who died
    about 1520, illustrates the tradition that St. Anne, the mother of the
    Virgin Mary, was three times married, Joachim being her third husband;
    the other two were Cleophas and Salome. This composition of seventeen
    figures is signed</p>

  <div class="center small">LAURENTIVS PAPIEN FECIT MDXIII,</div>

  <p class="noindent">and is one of the latest examples of this tradition, which
    about 1520 passed out of art.</p>

  <p>A large Triptych (No. 1384), signed</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">JOH̄NES MAZONVS<br />
    DE ALEXĀ PINXIT,</div>

  <p class="noindent">is by Giovanni Massone, who worked at Alessandria in the
    second half of the fifteenth century; it contains the portraits of Pope
    Sixtus <span class="smcap">iv.</span> with St. Francis of Assisi and Cardinal Giuliano
    della Rovere under the protection of St. Anthony of Padua. Cardinal
    Giuliano della Rovere was Bishop of Savona about 1483; he was in 1503
    elected Pope under the title of Julius <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, and became the
    patron of Raphael.</p>

  <p>The remaining pictures of this school are of little account. Bernardino
    Campi (1522–1592?) is represented by a <cite>Mater Dolorosa</cite> (No. 1202); and
    Bartolommeo Manfredi (1580?–1617) by a <cite>Fortune Teller</cite> (No. 1368), a
    subject which demonstrates the Decadence in full operation. Giovanni
    Paolo Panini (1695–1764), who came to Paris in 1732 and became an
    Academician, seems to have got some satisfaction out of committing to
    canvas a <cite>Concert given at Rome on Dec. 26, 1729, in Honour of the
    Birth of the Dauphin, the son of Louis XV.</cite> (No. 1409) and a large

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_FERRARA-BOLOGNA">THE SCHOOL OF FERRARA-BOLOGNA</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE city of Bologna was visited in 1268 by Oderigi of Gubbio (fl.
    1268–1295), who had the benefit of personal intercourse with Giotto in
    Rome. Bologna produced a skilled miniature painter in Franco Bolognese
    in the fourteenth century, but gave birth to few native painters
    of merit. Until Francesco Cossa removed from Ferrara to Bologna in
    1470, art in the City of the Colonnades was in an undeveloped state.
    The school of Bologna, which may be considered as an offshoot of the
    Ferrarese school, was further strengthened by the arrival of Lorenzo
    Costa.</p>

  <p>Lorenzo Costa (1460–1535), who had been a pupil of Francesco Cossa at
    Ferrara, worked for the Bentivogli family in Bologna until 1509. In
    that year he was induced to fix his abode in Mantua at the instance of
    the Marquis Francesco Gonzaga and his wife Isabella d’Este, whose court
    painter, Andrea Mantegna, had died three years earlier. Costa there
    painted about 1510 his <cite>Court of Isabella d’Este in the Garden of the
    Muses</cite> (No. 1261), which is signed</p>

  <div class="center small">L. COSTA F.</div>

  <p>This famous canvas shows a weakness of drawing and a “want of force
    that mars what is meant for grace.” Costa’s <cite>Mythological Scene</cite> (No.
    1262) is not now exhibited, but in it, as in the majority of his works,
    the figures have no real existence. The heads are usually “screwed
    on—not always at the proper angle—to crosspoles hung about with
    clothes.” His landscapes, however, “without being in any sense serious
    studies, are among the loveliest painted in his day.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

  <p>Costa’s shortcomings were to dominate to the end the school of
    Bologna, which was essentially, almost from its incipience, one of
    Decadence. He became the first direct master of Francesco Francia
    (1450–1517), the typical Renaissance painter in Bologna who seems to
    have taken to painting at the relatively advanced age of thirty-five.
    Francia had matriculated in the Goldsmiths’ Guild in 1482 and was
    Master of the Guild in 1483, the year of Costa’s arrival; but until he
    came under the influence of Costa he had worked only as an engraver of
    <i>paci</i> in niello-work, a die-sinker, and a medallist. They soon went
    into partnership, the upper storey of their joint workshop being used
    for the painting of pictures, while metal-work was executed below.
    Francia is not seen to the best advantage in the Louvre. His <cite>Christ
    on the Cross</cite> (No. 1436) is somewhat unusual in treatment, as a nude
    figure of St. Job, a plague saint, is painted in the foreground. This
    large picture bears the characteristic signature</p>

  <div class="center small">FRANCIA AURIFABER,</div>

  <p class="noindent">and shows his practice of demonstrating the versatility of his many
    talents. The small <cite>Nativity</cite> (No. 1435) is an authentic work. The
    <cite>Madonna and Child, with St. George, St. Sebastian, St. Francis,
    and St. John the Baptist</cite> (No. 1436<span class="smcap">a</span>), is known as the
    <cite>Guastavillani Madonna</cite> from the inscription to the effect that Filippo
    Guastavillani, a Bolognese senator, ordered the picture of Francia.
    Nevertheless, this large panel appears to have been executed by his
    son, Giacomo. A <cite>Madonna and Child</cite> (No. 1437) and a <cite>Holy Family with
    St. Francis d’Assisi</cite> (No. 1437<span class="smcap">a</span>) are only by pupils.</p>

  <p>The Louvre contains no example of the work of the Umbrian artist,
    Timoteo Viti (1467–1524), who was a pupil of Costa, and from July 1490
    to April 1495 worked in the studio of Francia. There are no other
    sixteenth-century Bolognese paintings in this collection.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS small and unimportant school includes Boccaccio Boccaccino
    (fl. 1460–1518?), who was formed on various Venetian and Milanese
    influences. The <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1168) which is credited to him, but
    not now exhibited, seems to be an unattributable panel by some artist
    of the Lombard school. This school includes an early-sixteenth-century
    imitator who has received the significant name of “Pseudo-Boccaccino,”
    but is not here represented.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Mater Dolorosa</cite> (No. 1202) appears to be by Bernardino Campi,
    a mediocre sixteenth-century painter of the Lombard and Cremonese
    schools. Sofonisba Anguissola (1528–1625), a female artist, was his
    pupil and the wife of Orazio Lomellini. </p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS small town seems to have produced little local talent previous to
    the birth of Foppa. Ottaviano Prandino, who had worked with Altichiero
    at Padua, and Bartolommeo Testorino (died about 1429) are little more
    than names.</p>

  <p>Vincenzo Foppa (1427?–1516?) was born near Brescia. The theory that
    he studied under Squarcione at Padua lacks confirmation. On the other
    hand, he seems to have been little affected by the Squarcionesque
    traditions, and is rather to be regarded as the artistic product of
    the school of Verona, where he would have come under the influence
    of Pisanello and Jacopo Bellini. He may have been a friend of Andrea
    Mantegna. It is, however, not in Brescia, but in Milan that Foppa’s art
    may be studied to-day. He arrived in Pavia about 1458, and became the
    founder of the school of Milan twenty years before Leonardo first took
    up his abode at the court of Lodovico Il Moro.</p>

  <p>Foppa’s pupil Vincenzo Civerchio (1470?–1544) and Floriano Ferramola
    (1480–1528) were the joint founders of the school of Brescia; Romanino
    (1485–1566) was a pupil of the latter. The Louvre is singularly poor
    in its representation of this school, which cannot here be studied
    earlier than the (so-called) <cite>Portrait of Gaston de Foix</cite> (No. 1518) by
    Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo (1480?–1548?). This canvas, which appears to
    be signed</p>

  <div class="center"><cite>Opera di Jovanni Jeronimo di Bressia di Savoldi</cite>,</div>

  <p class="noindent">shows unmistakably the conflicting influences, mostly Venetian, under
    which this artist worked.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

  <p>Moretto (1498?–1555?), who was a pupil of Ferramola and was influenced
    by Savoldo and Romanino, produced large and striking altarpieces as
    well as portraits. He met with some success in his attempts to combine
    a subtlety of feeling peculiar to himself with the “silvery” tones of
    which he was so fond. His <cite>St. Bernardino of Siena and St. Louis of
    Toulouse</cite> (No. 1175) and his <cite>St. Bonaventura and St. Anthony of Padua</cite>
    (No. 1176) are arched panels on a much smaller scale than he often uses.</p>

  <p>Moretto’s pupil, Giambattista Moroni (1525?–1578), painted many far
    better portraits than that of <cite>An Old Man seated</cite> (No. 1395). The only
    other Brescian painting in this collection seems to be the <cite>Portrait of
    a Man</cite> (No. 1646), who is seen at half length, seated three-quarters to
    the left and wearing a robe trimmed with fur. Although catalogued as
    an unattributable Italian work, it is in our opinion by Calisto Piazza
    of Lodi (fl. 1520–1560), the son of Martino Piazza of the Milanese
    school. To Calisto da Lodi has been assigned the <cite>Portrait of a Knight
    of Malta</cite> (No. 1594) which is catalogued as being by Titian.</p>

  <p>The Louvre is very inferior to the National Gallery in both the quality
    and quantity of pictures of this school.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE city of Modena gave birth to the early painters Tommaso da Modena
    (1325–1379) and Barnaba da Modena (fl. 1377), who worked in many
    different parts of Tuscany. The prominent figure in this school,
    however, is Francesco Bianchi (1460–1510). This painter, whose name is
    sometimes given as Francesco Bianchi Ferrari, was in all probability
    a pupil of Cosimo Tura at Ferrara. He left that city about 1480 for
    Modena. His style of painting has been the subject of much discussion,
    chiefly because he is regarded as the master of Correggio of Parma.
    The <cite>Madonna and Child, with St. Benedict and St. Quentin</cite> (No. 1167),
    although officially catalogued under his name, is not now generally
    accepted as his work. In 1725 it was in the Church of St. Quentin
    at Parma and attributed to Francia. Certain critics have ascribed
    it to Alessandro da Carpi and others to Pellegrino Munari of Modena
    (1450?–1523). Bianchi’s work can only be studied in the Pinacoteca
    Estense and in the churches at Modena.</p>

  <p>The three pictures officially catalogued under the name of the
    third-rate artist Bartolommeo Schidone (1570?–1615) are not exhibited,
    nor are they missed,—a remark which will also apply to a <cite>St. Cecilia</cite>
    (No. 1253) by Jacopo Cavedone (1577–1660). </p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE first Vicentine painter known to us is Battista da Vicenza (fl.
    1450), but it was not until the last quarter of the fifteenth century
    that Vicenza produced a painter of any note. Bartolommeo Montagna
    (1460?–1523) studied the art of the Vivarini, and so became the central
    figure in an unimportant school. His <cite>Ecce Homo</cite> (No. 1393), which
    bears the signature:</p>

  <div class="center lh1"><i>Bartholomeus Montagna<br />
    Fecit</i></div>

  <p class="noindent">in a <i>cartellino</i> fastened to a twig, is a mature work. The delightful
    and late picture of <cite>Three Angel Musicians</cite> (No. 1394), which is signed
    in a <i>cartellino</i></p>

  <div class="center lh1"><i>Opus Bartholomei<br />
    Montagna</i>,</div>

  <p class="noindent">shows the unmistakable influence of Gentile Bellini. The same motif is
    found in the three musician angels in Montagna’s magnificent <cite>Madonna
    and Child, with St. Andrew, St. Monica, St. Ursula, and St. Sigismund</cite>,
    of 1498, in the Brera.</p>

  <p>Montagna’s son, Benedetto (fl. 1500–1540), Giovanni Buonconsiglio
    (1470?–1536?), and Giovanni Speranza (1480–1536) also practised as
    painters; but Vicentine art from the middle of the sixteenth century
    has little claim on our attention. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_VERCELLI">THE SCHOOL OF VERCELLI</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ONE of the earliest painters in this school was an obscure artist of
    the Old Lombard school named Martino Spanzotti. He was the master of
    Gaudenzio Ferrari (1471–1546), whose frescoes are easily recognisable
    by the crude colour, exuberant imagination, and forceful, almost
    brutal, realism which have caused him to be termed, somewhat loosely,
    the Rubens of Italy. A very late work by him is the <cite>St. Paul</cite> (No.
    1285), which is signed and dated</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">1543<br />
    GAUDENTIUS.</div>

  <p>Another of Spanzotti’s pupils was Sodoma, who was born at Vercelli in
    Piedmont, in 1477. He is best known for the large amount of work that
    he executed at Siena. This prolific artist, like a number of other
    painters of this unimportant school, is not represented in the Louvre.
    He died in 1551.</p>

  <p>A faint echo of the teaching of Spanzotti may at times be detected in
    the works of Defendente Ferrari (fl. 1500–1535) and Girolamo Giovenone
    (fl. 1513–1527), who are not represented in the Louvre. </p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ONE of the most distinctive and perhaps the most sensuous of the
    Italian masters is Correggio (1494–1534), who takes his name from his
    birthplace, Il Correggio, a small town near Modena. It was natural,
    therefore, that he should have become the pupil of Francesco Bianchi
    of the school of Modena. Correggio came under almost all the leading
    influences which distinguish the principal Italian schools of the
    early sixteenth century. His “sidelong grace,” his subtle gradations
    of tone, his daring foreshortening, his sublimity of space and light,
    his vivid imagination, his profound knowledge of chiaroscuro, render
    him an isolated phenomenon in Italian art at the moment when it was
    passing into precipitate decline. His <cite>Marriage of St. Catherine</cite>
    (No. 1117, <a href="#i_plate15">Plate XV.</a>) entirely lacks the dignity and solemnity which
    are the dominant features of truly religious art. The figures which
    make up this fascinating composition are delicate, but by no means
    of an elevated type. This pseudo-religious picture, when studied
    together with the <cite>Jupiter and Antiope</cite> (No. 1118), shows the justice
    of the criticism that Correggio’s pictures are “hymns to the charm of
    femininity the like of which have never been known before or since in
    Christian Europe.” It is more remarkable that this mythological canvas,
    which is so full of sensuous vitality, should have been added to the
    royal collection of England in the seventeenth century than that it
    should have been allowed by Cromwell to leave the country a few years
    later. Two Allegories of <cite>Virtue</cite> and <cite>Vice</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> executed by Correggio in
    gouache, hang in one of the Rooms of Drawings.</p>

  <p>Parmigianino (1504–1540), an imitator of Correggio and in a less degree
    of Raphael, who were both shortlived artists, painted the two small
    panels of a <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1385), and a <cite>Holy Family and Saints</cite>
    (No. 1386).</p>

    <h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_BOLOGNA">THE SCHOOL OF BOLOGNA</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AFTER the deaths of Francia in 1517 and Lorenzo Costa in 1536, painting
    in Bologna rapidly decreased in quality, although not in volume. A
    distinctive feature was the work of Marc Antonio Raimondi (b. 1475), a
    pupil of Francia, who developed the process of engraving on copper.</p>

  <p>Bologna, which like other cities of Italy felt the effects of humanism,
    acquired an increased importance in political activity through the
    meeting there of Pope Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span> and Francis <span class="smcap">i.</span>, in
    1515, and by the Coronation of Charles <span class="smcap">v.</span>, on Feb. 24, 1530.
    It also obtained within a few years a great reputation as an art
    centre, although it is not easy for us now to realise why. The esteem
    in which its art was held in foreign countries is also difficult
    to explain. Innocenzo da Imola, who had studied under Francia, was
    the master of Primaticcio, who was summoned to France by François
    <span class="smcap">i.</span> in 1531. Primaticcio at that time was working at Mantua
    with Giulio Romano, the favourite pupil and the imitator of Raphael.
    While Primaticcio took with him the influence of Bolognese art to
    Fontainebleau, where he died in 1570, Pellegrino Tibaldi (1527–1591), a
    pupil of Bagnacavallo, carried the Bolognese influence into Spain.</p>

  <p>The appreciation by a foreign artist of the art of Bologna is shown in
    the case of Denis Calvaert of Antwerp, who thought the Bolognese school
    to be in so flourishing a state, when he passed through on his way to
    study in Rome, that he decided to abandon his original intention and to
    stay on in the city of the Colonnades.</p>

  <p>A striking feature of the literature and art of painting at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> Bologna
    was that its University had always accorded equal terms to women
    students with men, and had women professors. Female painters—they were
    without exception only of the third rank—had worked in Bologna from the
    days of Caterina di Vigri, painter and saint, who was born as early
    as 1413. In the last quarter of the sixteenth century, art in Bologna
    passed into the complete control of the Eclectics.</p>

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
    <h2 id="THE_DECADENT_SCHOOLS">THE DECADENT SCHOOLS</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN the Florentine and Roman schools the Decadence may be said to have
    begun with the death of Raphael in 1520. With the exception of the
    Venetian school, in which art did not languish until after the death
    of Tintoretto in 1594, painting rapidly degenerated during the second
    half of the sixteenth century. Paintings were, of course, produced in
    great profusion in every art centre of Italy, but form and subject were
    not in true harmony. To a great extent local traditions were abandoned,
    the earlier types varied, and three distinctive movements developed—the
    “Mannerists,” the “Eclectics,” and the “Naturalists.”</p>

  <h3 id="THE_MANNERISTS">THE “MANNERISTS”</h3>

  <p>Giulio Romano (1492?–1546) was content to imitate the works of Raphael;
    and Daniele da Volterra (1509–1566) tried, as we have seen in his
    <cite>David overcoming Goliath</cite> (No. 1462), to reproduce the swelling
    muscles of Michelangelo. Baroccio (1526–1612) in his <cite>Circumcision</cite>
    (No. 1149), which is signed and dated 1570, and in his <cite>Virgin in
    Glory, with St. Anthony and St. Lucy</cite> (No. 1150), sought to reproduce
    the ineffable grace of Correggio; while others endeavoured to
    repeat the enigmatic smile, the “greyhound” eye, and the mysterious
    chiaroscuro of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

  <p>Although the “Mannerists” were to be met with in most of the centres of
    painting in the sixteenth century, they made Rome the centre of their
    operations. Domenico Feti (1589–1624) is represented in the Louvre by
    four canvases, <cite>Nero</cite> (No. 1286),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> <cite>Life in the Country</cite> (No. 1287),
    <cite>Melancholy</cite> (No. 1288), and <cite>The Guardian Angel</cite> (No. 1289), the
    subjects being highly significant.</p>

  <p>In the <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 1493) by Sassoferrato (1605–1685) are shown
    the shallowness and empty formalism which produced the fair-haired,
    blue-eyed, hyper-sentimental <cite>Madonnas</cite> with which his name is
    associated. Carlo Dolci is not represented in the Louvre.</p>

  <p>One of the more estimable artists in the Late Roman school is Carlo
    Maratta (1625–1713), who may be judged by the unsigned <cite>Portrait of
    Marie Madeleine Rospigliosi</cite> (No. 1379) and <cite>His Own Portrait</cite> (No.
    1380).</p>

  <p>Two paintings of <cite>Fruit</cite> (Nos. 1254, 1255) stand to the credit of M.
    A. Cerquozzi (1602–1660), and the art of G. B. Castiglione, of Genoa
    (1616–1670), is seen in his <cite>Abraham and Melchizedek</cite> (No. 1250) and
    <cite>Animals and Utensils</cite> (No. 1252).</p>

  <h3 id="THE_ECLECTICS">THE “ECLECTICS”</h3>

  <p>A revolt against the methods of the “Mannerists” was made by the
    Carracci when they opened their school of art at Bologna in 1589.
    These “Eclectics” (“Pickers and Choosers”) advocated a careful study
    of “the drawing of Rome, the Venetian shadow, the terrific force
    of Michelangelo’s manner, the natural truth of Titian, the pure
    and sovereign style of Correggio, the true symmetry of Raphael,
    the dignity and principle of Tibaldi, the invention of the learned
    Primaticcio, together with a little of the grace of Parmigianino”! It
    is not surprising that they in their turn soon sank into mere academic
    mediocrity.</p>

  <p>The Louvre is notoriously rich in representative examples of the
    “Eclectic” painters’ art. The name of Lodovico Carracci (1555–1619),
    the founder of this school at Bologna, is included in the official
    Catalogue, but neither of his two pictures is at present exhibited.
    Lodovico had as cousins, Agostino (1557?–1602) and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> Annibale
    (1560?–1609), who also worked in Rome. Six of Annibale Carracci’s
    fifteen pictures in this collection are now exhibited. The <cite>Madonna of
    the Cherries</cite> (No. 1217) and the <cite>Sleeping Child Jesus</cite> (No. 1218) are
    characteristic, while his huge canvas of <cite>The Virgin appearing to St.
    Luke and St. Catherine</cite> (No. 1219) in every way exemplifies the art of
    this painter and his school. It is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small">ANNIBAL CARACTIUS F. MDXCII.</div>

  <p>Pictures of this type were much sought after and prized in the
    eighteenth century, when this one was seized by Napoleon in Italy,
    but to-day a higher standard of æsthetics has deservedly ruled them
    out of fashion. On the other hand, sufficient attention is not now
    paid to some of the landscape pictures which the “Eclectics” painted;
    Annibale’s <cite>Fishing</cite> (No. 1233) and <cite>Hunting</cite> (No. 1232) are worth the
    attention of the student. Antonio Carracci (1583–1618), a less-known
    member of this family, is the author of a large canvas depicting <cite>The
    Deluge</cite> (No. 1235).</p>

  <p>Guido Reni, after working under Denis Calvaert at Bologna, entered
    the school of the Carracci. This fitful sentimentalist indulged in
    idealised abstractions that were neither human nor divine, as may
    be seen from his <cite>David and Goliath</cite> (No. 1439) and <cite>St. Sebastian</cite>
    (No. 1450) on the one hand, and his <cite>Ecce Homo</cite> (No. 1447) and <cite>Mary
    Magdalene</cite> (No. 1448) on the other. Four of his large mythological
    paintings (Nos. 1453, 1454, 1455, 1457) show some technical ability.</p>

  <p>Francesco Albani (1578–1660) was influenced by the Carracci and Guido
    Reni. The <cite>Diana and Actaeon</cite> (No. 1111) may be selected out of his
    nine productions mentioned in the Catalogue. Domenichino (1581–1641),
    a pupil of the Carracci, the assistant of Annibale and a friend of
    Guido Reni in Rome, was a sentimentalist of the most pronounced order.
    His hard execution and unpleasant colouring can be judged in his <cite>St.
    Cecilia</cite> (No. 1613),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>—her features are singularly ill-proportioned,—but
    nine of his other pictures do not take up any of the valuable wall
    space.</p>

  <p>The self-taught artist and insipid Guercino (“The Squintling”)
    (1591–1666), after working in Rome, settled in 1642 at Bologna, where
    he died in affluent circumstances. His <cite>Raising of Lazarus</cite> (No.
    1139), the large <cite>Patron Saints of Modena</cite> (No. 1143), together with a
    <cite>Circe</cite> (No. 1147) and <cite>The Painters Own Portrait</cite> (No. 1148), are now
    exhibited. These and such pictures as were painted by G. A. Donducci
    (1575–1655), G. F. Grimaldi (1606–1680), S. Cantarini (1612–1648), and
    G. M. Crespi (1665–1747), provoked a fresh reaction.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_NATURALISTS">THE “NATURALISTS”</h3>

  <p>A natural reaction against the selective methods of the “Eclectics”
    gave rise to the “Naturalists,” who, headed by Michelangelo Caravaggio
    (1569–1609), made Naples the centre of their operations. The utterly
    repulsive picture entitled <cite>The Death of the Virgin</cite> (No. 1121), by
    Caravaggio, is merely large. Neither <cite>The Fortune Teller</cite> (No. 1122)
    nor the <cite>Concert of Nine Musicians</cite> (No. 1123) can be compared with
    the really striking and well-painted <cite>Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt,
    Grand-Master of Malta</cite> (No. 1124).</p>

  <p>Salvator Rosa (1615–1675) is represented by <cite>Tobias and the Angel</cite> (No.
    1477) and a <cite>Vision of Saul to Samuel</cite> (No. 1478). His <cite>Landscape</cite> (No.
    1480) shows that he delighted in “ideas of desolation, solitude and
    danger, impenetrable forests, rocky and storm-lashed shores, in lonely
    dells leading to dens and caverns of banditti, alpine ridges, trees
    blasted by lightning or sapped by time.” His <cite>Battle</cite> (No. 1479) is a
    strange production.</p>

  <p>Caravaggio was the master of Ribera (1588–1656), who is also called
    Spagnoletto, and is included in the Catalogue among the Spanish
    artists. This “Naturalist” school of Naples also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> included Luca
    Giordano (1632–1705), who lived in Spain at one period.</p>

  <p>The aim of the “Naturalists” is displayed in the prominence they gave
    to all that was vulgar, coarse, and vile. With them art in Italy came
    to an ignominious end, although in technical accomplishment, in mere
    craftsmanship, they can hold their own with painters of much higher
    rank. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_EARLY_FLEMISH_SCHOOL">THE EARLY FLEMISH SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE early art of Flanders, unlike that of Italy, does not present
    itself at the Louvre, or indeed at any Gallery, in orderly sequence
    from the immature groping for artistic expression to masterly
    achievement. With the exception of the exquisite work of the
    late-fourteenth-century miniaturists, which forms a special branch
    of study, there is nothing to bridge the immense gulf that divides
    Melchior Broederlam, the earliest known Flemish painter, from the
    brothers Van Eyck, whose earliest known work, the wonderful Ghent
    polyptych of <cite>The Adoration of the Lamb</cite>, is, if not quite the
    starting-point, the noblest achievement of the Early Flemish school.
    The invention of oil-painting, in the sense of the word as it is
    applied to-day, with which the Van Eycks are credited, no doubt
    contributed largely towards this amazingly sudden progress; but their
    art also marks a new era in the conception of life and pictorial form.
    An ardent love of truth and nature takes the place of the earlier vague
    idealism. At the same time, the realism of the brothers Van Eyck and
    their followers, notwithstanding its insistence on literal truth in
    the representation of frequently ugly details, was kept in check by
    deep sentiment, love of splendid colour, and a great sense of style in
    composition. Details, even in the far-away distance, were certainly
    elaborated with minute precision, but they are never unduly obtrusive,
    and are invariably subordinated to the main motive.</p>

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
    <h3 id="JAN_VAN_EYCK">JAN VAN EYCK</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The earliest important Flemish painting in the Louvre is the famous
    <cite>Virgin and Child with the Chancellor Rolin</cite> (No. 1986, <a href="#i_plate16">Plate XVI.</a>) by
    Jan van Eyck (<i>c.</i> 1390–1441), which was taken by order of Napoleon
    I. from the Collegiate Church of Autun in Burgundy. In a three-aisled
    colonnaded hall with stilted arches and pavement of geometrical inlay
    is seen Nicholas Rolin, Chancellor of Burgundy and Brabant, kneeling
    at a prayer-desk before the Virgin, on whose right knee is seated the
    Infant Saviour holding an orb in His left and raising His right hand
    in benediction. An angel with peacock-blue wings is floating above the
    Virgin and holding an elaborately wrought golden crown over her head.
    The exquisite detail of the river landscape with a view of Maastricht
    extending beyond the open colonnade, the sumptuous brocaded dresses,
    the carved capitals of columns and piers, and many other details
    painted with inimitable minute skill, help towards an ensemble of
    jewel-like splendour dimmed but not marred by the yellow varnish which
    covers the surface. The <cite>Virgin with the Donor</cite> was formerly generally
    attributed to Hubert, but is most probably a late work by Jan van Eyck,
    painted perhaps about 1432.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_TOURNAI">THE SCHOOL OF TOURNAI</h3>

  <p>Neither Petrus Christus (1412?–1473), the only master who was directly
    influenced by Jan van Eyck, nor Robert Campin (1365–1444), who is now
    known to be identical with the so-called “Maître de Flémalle,” and
    who was the head of the important Tournai school, are represented
    at the Louvre. The official Catalogue ascribes to Campin’s greatest
    pupil, Rogier van der Weyden (<i>c.</i> 1400–1464), the two panels <cite>The
    Virgin and Child</cite> (No. 2195), and <cite>The Deposition from the Cross</cite> (No.
    2196), of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> at least the former is only a school version of an
    often repeated theme by the master, whilst the <cite>Deposition</cite> is by no
    means an important example of his work. Rogier was born at Tournai,
    but went to Brussels after 1432, and practised in that city until his
    death in 1464. A journey to Italy in 1449 did not appreciably affect
    his art, which always retained an archaic flavour, especially in the
    rather tortured rendering of the nude. In this respect, and also in
    his utter disregard of beauty (except the beauty of rhythmic line), he
    compares unfavourably with the brothers Van Eyck, as may be clearly
    seen on comparing his work with Jan van Eyck’s <cite>Virgin and Donor</cite>. His
    occasional use of gold backgrounds, as in the <cite>Virgin and Child</cite> (No.
    2195), is another archaic trait.</p>

  <p>The hand of a nameless contemporary and follower of Campin and Rogier
    van der Weyden, who is also represented at the Galleries of Vienna,
    Turin, and Antwerp, is to be recognised in the small panel of <cite>The
    Annunciation</cite> (No. 2202), which was formerly attributed to the much
    later painter Lucas van Leyden, and has also been claimed to be only a
    copy of a picture by the Maître de Flémalle.</p>

  <h3 id="HANS_MEMLINC">HANS MEMLINC</h3>

  <p>The influence of Rogier van der Weyden determined the entire course
    taken by the Flemish school until its decline with the introduction
    of those Italian Renaissance tendencies which only became a vital
    factor and led to the birth of a new Flemish art through the genius of
    Rubens. Again, Rogier’s chief pupil, Dierick Bouts (<i>c.</i> 1410–1475),
    is unrepresented at the Louvre. In the art of Hans Memlinc (<i>c.</i>
    1430?–1494), who was the founder of the great school of Bruges, may be
    found clear traces of the influence of Rogier and of Bouts, although
    we have no certain knowledge as to that master’s actual pupilage. He
    may have been born at Mömlingen, near Aschaffenburg on the Main, and
    apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> had already risen to fame as a painter before 1467, the
    date of his great altarpiece at Dantzig. By that time he was settled
    at Bruges. Mr. W. H. J. Weale’s researches have shown that the legend,
    according to which Memlinc first came to Bruges as a wounded soldier
    and was nursed back to health at the Hospital of St. John, is not
    founded on fact. It is probable that Memlinc served his apprenticeship
    under some Cologne painter, but all theories regarding his early life
    must remain largely conjectural.</p>

  <p>What is of real importance is that he introduced into the detailed
    realism of his precursors a note of pious fervour and tender idealism,
    which is the nearest approach in Northern art to the angelic sweetness
    of Fra Giovanni da Fiesole. Not without good reason has he been called
    “the Fra Angelico of the North.” Fromentin was certainly right in
    saying that “Van Eyck saw with his eyes, Memlinc begins to see with
    his soul.” It is this warmth of feeling that makes Memlinc the most
    lovable painter of the Flemish school, for he could neither rival the
    dramatic power and realistic truth of the Van Eycks, nor the firm
    draughtsmanship of Van der Weyden, nor Bouts’s skill in landscape
    painting. Nor did he take full advantage of the possibilities of the
    oil technique, his method remaining that of the tempera painters,
    although he availed himself of the new medium.</p>

  <p>The earliest work by Memlinc in the great French national collection
    is the charming little diptych, painted about 1475, and representing
    on one leaf <cite>The Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine</cite> (No. 2027), and
    on the other <cite>The Donor, John du Celier, presented by St. John</cite> (No.
    2027<span class="smcap">a</span>). In the first the Virgin is seen seated in a flowering
    meadow in front of a rose-covered trellis and supporting the Infant
    Christ, who bends forward to place the ring on the finger of St.
    Catherine on the left. Behind the saintly bride are St. Agnes and St.
    Cecilia; whilst the group on the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> comprises St. Barbara, with
    St. Margaret and St. Lucy, all accompanied by their characteristic
    attributes. On the other leaf the Donor is seen kneeling, with hands
    joined in prayer, in front of St. John the Baptist, who is pointing to
    Our Lord. The landscape background shows, on the left, the Apocalyptic
    vision of St. John the Evangelist, and on the right, St. George
    fighting the Dragon. This leaf, after passing through the collection
    of Mr. Herz and Mr. Heath, was presented to the Louvre in 1895 by
    Mme. André, and was thus reunited with its companion, which had been
    bequeathed to the Gallery fourteen years earlier by M. E. Gatteaux. It
    is on the whole in an excellent state of preservation, although some of
    the accessories in the background are so thinly painted that they have
    almost disappeared.</p>

  <h3 id="MEMLINCS_VIRGIN_AND_CHILD_WITH_DONORS">MEMLINC’S “VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH DONORS”</h3>

  <p>About 1490 Memlinc must have painted the admirable <cite>Virgin and Child,
    with Donors</cite> (No. 2026), which was commissioned by James Floreins, a
    member of the Bruges Merchant Grocers’ Guild, but subsequently found
    its way to Spain, whence it was taken to France by General d’Armagnac.
    The Donor, who is kneeling on the left, in front of his seven sons,
    is presented by St. James the Great, the same office being performed
    by St. Dominic for Floreins’s wife and her twelve daughters, on
    the opposite side. The scene is laid in a Romanesque church, with
    openings at either side, through which glimpses of the landscape
    beyond are obtained. The characterisation of all the faces, which
    bear a strong family likeness, is as admirable as the painting of the
    noble architecture. Remarkable, too, is the effect of perfect symmetry
    obtained in the arrangement of the two unequal groups through the
    simple device of placing the Virgin and Child more towards the less
    crowded side, although the canopy is in the exact middle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> panel.
    This altarpiece is certainly one of the most important works by Memlinc
    that are to be found outside Belgium.</p>

  <p>The two little panels, <cite>St. John the Baptist</cite> (No. 2024), and <cite>St. Mary
    Magdalene</cite> (No. 2025), both standing in a landscape with small scenes
    from their respective legends, formed originally, with two further
    panels representing St. Christopher and St. Stephen, the shutters of a
    triptych. The centre part had disappeared before the wings, carefully
    sawn through the thickness of the panels so, as to separate the obverse
    from the reverse, came into the possession of Lucien Bonaparte, and
    afterwards of William II. of Holland. The two Saints now at the Louvre
    were purchased in 1851 for £469.</p>

  <p>In 1908 the Louvre obtained, at the high price of £8000, the <cite>Portrait
    of an Old Lady</cite> (<a href="#i_plate17">Plate XVII.</a>), to which attention was first drawn
    at the Bruges Exhibition in 1902, when it was shown by M. Nardus,
    from whom it passed into the hands of M. Kleinberger. Both the Paris
    portrait, which is drawn with exquisite precision but has apparently
    suffered from over-cleaning, and its companion, the portrait of this
    anonymous lady’s husband at the Berlin Museum, were until 1884 in the
    Meazzu collection in Milan.</p>

  <p>The triptych (No. 2028) with (<i>a</i>) <cite>The Resurrection</cite>, (<i>b</i>) <cite>The
    Ascension</cite>, and (<i>c</i>) <cite>The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian</cite>, which was
    bought at Turin in 1860 for £540, and is officially considered to be
    of doubtful authenticity, is included by Mr. Weale in his catalogue of
    Memlinc’s works.</p>

  <h3 id="GERARD_DAVID">GERARD DAVID</h3>

  <p>The reconstruction and the rescuing from oblivion of the artistic
    personality of Gerard David, begun by Mr. Weale and completed by
    Freiherr von Bodenhausen, is one of the triumphs of the modern
    scientific method of criticism. The Louvre is fortunate in possessing
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>two important examples from the brush of this master, who, born
    at Ouwater in Holland about 1460, was in his early studies influenced
    by Albert van Ouwater, but, after settling at Bruges in 1483, came
    under the spell of Van Eyck, Bouts, and above all of Memlinc, whom he
    succeeded as leader of the Bruges school. On his death in 1523, the
    supremacy of that school came to an end, and passed on to the city of
    Antwerp, which by that time had also superseded Bruges as a commercial
    centre. Gerard David was not Memlinc’s equal as regards intimate charm,
    but in his work is to be found a summing-up of all the achievement of
    the Flemish Quattrocento—“the last concentrated expression of the aims
    of all the great masters of that fertile age.”</p>

    [4]</a> This picture has not yet received an official number.</div>

  <p>After having been successively attributed to Van Eyck, Van der Weyden,
    Memlinc, and David’s pupil Ysenbrant, the <cite>Marriage at Cana</cite> (No.
    1957, <a href="#i_plate18">Plate XVIII.</a>) is now generally admitted to be designed and
    partly executed by Gerard David, although the panel shows unmistakable
    evidence of being completed by another and less skilful hand. Mr. Weale
    has shown, on the strength of a certain document, that the picture may
    have been finished by Ysenbrant, but he has been unable to establish
    that the document quoted by him refers to this particular picture.
    There can be no doubt that David himself painted the figure of the
    Donor, kneeling on the left, a marvellous example of early portraiture,
    and the Donor’s son, the Christ, and the boy carrying the cake. Some of
    the other heads are almost wooden in their hardness. The head of the
    Dominican looking into the hall through an opening beyond which is to
    be seen the Place du Saint-Sang, at Bruges, is clearly an afterthought,
    and is introduced so clumsily that the wall and the page-boy with the
    cake-dish really leave no room for the friar’s body. There is a curious
    lack of spiritual cohesion in the picture—the majority of the figures
    look away from the Saviour as well as from the bride, although the
    significance of the moment is such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> as to demand a concentration of
    everybody’s attention on the Christ. The picture, of which there are
    several replicas, notably one at the Stockholm Museum by David’s pupil
    Ambrosius Benson, was until 1580 in the Chapel of the Saint-Sang at
    Bruges, and then in the collection of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>, from which
    it passed into the Louvre.</p>

  <p>The triptych (No. 2202<span class="smcap">a</span>) of the <cite>Virgin and Child, with Two
    Angels</cite>, in the centre, and <cite>Two Donors presented by St. John the
    Baptist and St. John the Evangelist</cite>, on the wings, is officially
    catalogued as an anonymous picture of the Flemish sixteenth-century
    school, but is unquestionably an early work of Gerard David. It is
    interesting to note that the male Donor is the same as the Donor in the
    <cite>Marriage at Cana</cite>, though younger in years, and that the delightful
    and strangely Italian <i lang="it">putti</i> on the capitals of the columns that
    flank the Virgin’s throne recur again, reversed, in David’s <cite>Judgment
    of Cambyses</cite>, at Bruges. The <cite>Adam</cite> and <cite>Eve</cite> on the outside of the
    shutters are inspired by the corresponding figures on the great Van
    Eyck altarpiece at Ghent. The Louvre triptych was bought at the Garriga
    sale in Madrid, in 1890, for £248.</p>

  <h3 id="HIERONYMUS_BOSCH">HIERONYMUS BOSCH</h3>

  <p>Before passing on to the school founded at Antwerp by Quentin Matsys
    (<i>c.</i> 1466–1530), mention should be made of Hieronymus Bosch van Aeken
    (<i>c.</i> 1462–1516), who, a follower of Ouwater, has as much right to
    be counted among the masters of the Dutch as of the Flemish school.
    Of his life we know but little. His pictures reveal that realistic
    observation of everyday life which was to become the characteristic of
    the Dutch school; but, added to it, there is a tendency towards the
    grotesque which made him delight in subjects that gave him full scope
    for the invention of weird monsters, devils, and spectres, such as the
    demons in <cite>The Damned</cite> (No. 1900), which is attributed to Bosch in
    the official Catalogue, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>but is, like its companion, <cite>Heaven</cite>, at
    the Lille Museum, the work of the unknown painter of the famous <cite>Last
    Judgment</cite> at Dantzig, which has by various experts been given in turn
    to Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Memlinc. There is at the
    Louvre a drawing which corresponds to so remarkable a degree with the
    panel No. 1900, that it has long been held to be a study from the same
    hand. This drawing is, however, more probably an early study by the
    German master Martin Schöngauer after the Louvre panel. The picture was
    formerly in the Duchâtel collection, and was given to the Louvre by the
    Duc de la Tremoïlle.</p>

  <p>Quentin Matsys, the painter of <cite>The Banker and his Wife</cite> (No. 2029,
    <a href="#i_plate19">Plate XIX.</a>), of which numerous replicas and variants are known, some
    probably from the hand of his pupil Marinus van Roymerswaele, still
    owes his training to the primitives of his race, but heralds the new
    era which was to culminate in the art of Rubens, by passing from the
    earlier minute precision of detail to a certain breadth of style and
    boldness of brushwork, necessitated partly by the larger scale adopted
    for his figures. Neither <cite>The Saviour Blessing</cite> (No. 2030) nor <cite>The
    Virgin and Child</cite> (No. 2030<span class="smcap">a</span>), both of which are catalogued
    under his name, can be accepted as authentic; but the interesting genre
    group of <cite>The Banker and his Wife</cite> is not only fully signed and dated</p>

  <div class="center small">QVENTIN MATSYS, SCHILDER, 1514,</div>

  <p class="noindent">but is unmistakably the work of his brush, although the
    woman’s face and hands appear to have been badly repainted. It was
    bought in 1806 at the low price of £72. The best version of the same
    subject is the one in the Sigmaringen Gallery. By Quentin Matsys is
    also, probably, the <cite>Pietà</cite> (No. 2203), which is catalogued officially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
    as “Flemish <span class="smcap">xvi</span>th Century.” Quentin’s son Jan, who followed
    his father’s tradition and achieved considerable distinction, is the
    painter of the hideous <cite>David and Bathsheba</cite> (No. 2030<span class="smcap">b</span>),
    which bears the inscription</p>

    <div class="center small">1562. IOANES MASSIIS PINGEBAT.</div>

  <p>Next in importance among the Antwerp masters is Jan Gossart (<i>c.</i>
    1470–1533?), better known as Mabuse, from the name of his native town
    Maubeuge in the Hainault. In his early work he followed the tradition
    of the great masters of his own country, but a journey to Italy in
    1508 made him change his manner, and led him to adopt, together with
    the amplitude of Italian design, a certain floridness which compares
    unfavourably with the honest realism of his precursors and which led to
    the rapid decadence of the Flemish school. In the magnificent portrait
    of <cite>Jean Carondelet, Perpetual Chancellor of Flanders</cite> (No. 1997, <a href="#i_plate20">Plate
    XX.</a>), although it was painted as late as 1517, he is still faithful
    to the great tradition of his country for honest, straightforward,
    shrewdly observed, and delicately wrought portraiture. An inscription
    on the top of the arched gilt frame reads:</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">REPRÉSENTACION DE MESSIRE JEHAN CARONDELET,<br />
    HAVLT DOYEN DE BESANÇON, EN SON EAGE DE 48Ā,</div>

  <p class="noindent">and, below, “<span class="smcap">fait l’an 1517</span>.” In a niche behind
    the panel are the letters “<span class="smcap">i c</span>” entwined with strings, and the
    motto “<span class="smcap">matvra</span>.” The portrait was, therefore, obviously painted
    just before Carondelet accompanied Charles <span class="smcap">v.</span> to Spain in 1517.</p>

  <p>This portrait panel, together with <cite>The Virgin and Child</cite> (No. 1998),
    which bears on the frame the inscription</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">MEDIATRIX NOSTRA QVE EST POST DEVM<br />
    SPES SOLA TVO FILIO ME REPRESENTA,</div>

  <p class="noindent">and the signature “<span class="smcap">johannes melbodie pingebat</span>,”
    formed a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>diptych which was bought in 1847 from a Valenciennes
    architect for the ridiculous price of £40! A later portrait of
    Carondelet by Mabuse, dated 1531, appeared in 1907 at Christie’s under
    the name of C. Amberger, and realised the price of £3885. Another
    portrait of Carondelet, by B. van Orley, is in the Munich Gallery,
    where it is officially ascribed to Quentin Matsys, who is probably the
    painter of yet another portrait of the Chancellor which was recently in
    the Duchâtel collection in Paris. The <cite>Portrait of a Benedictine</cite> (No.
    1999) bears the date 1526 and the signature</p>

  <div class="center small">JOANNE MALBOLD PINGE.</div>

  <p>The decline of the Antwerp school through the introduction of Italian
    mannerisms is illustrated in <cite>Young Tobias restoring Sight to his
    Father</cite> (No. 2001), a fully signed late picture by Jan van Hemessen,
    who flourished in that city towards the middle of the sixteenth
    century, and in whose art the last traces of the great national
    tradition disappear.</p>

  <p>Of the school that flourished in Brussels before Italianism appeared
    in the person of Barend van Orley (<i>c.</i> 1495–1542), the only name that
    has come down to posterity is that of Rogier van der Weyden’s follower,
    Colin de Coter, thanks to the clear inscription</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Colin de Coter pinxit me in Brabancia Bruxelle</i></div>

  <p class="noindent">on the hem of the dress of the kneeling Magdalen in <cite>The
    Holy Women</cite> (No. 1952<span class="smcap">b</span>), which, with <cite>The Trinity</cite> (No.
    1952<span class="smcap">a</span>) and another lost panel, probably originally formed a
    triptych. The signed wing was presented to the Gallery in 1903; whilst
    the <cite>Trinity</cite> centre-piece was bought two years later from the Abbé
    Toussaint at St. Omer for £120.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

  <p>Like Mabuse, Barend van Orley, after showing in his early work clear
    traces of his descent from the Flemish primitives, drank deeply at the
    fountain of Italian art. He was profoundly impressed by Raphael, from
    whom he endeavoured, with a certain degree of success, to learn the
    noble flow of drapery and the harmonious disposition of the design. On
    the other hand, he sacrificed the lustrous richness of Early Flemish
    colour and became addicted to dull grey shadows and pinkish lights. His
    <cite>Holy Family</cite> (No. 2067<span class="smcap">a</span>) does not rank with his finest works,
    <cite>The Last Judgment</cite> at Antwerp and the <cite>Holy Family</cite> at Liverpool. The
    architectural setting, with a statue of Neptune in a square in the
    background, indicates the advent of the Renaissance. The picture was
    bought at the Otlet sale in Brussels, in 1902, for £540. With Barend
    van Orley closes the chapter of the Early Flemish school. Indeed, he
    was rather the first of the new era than the last of the primitives.</p>

    <h2 id="THE_LATE_FLEMISH_SCHOOL">THE LATE FLEMISH SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE period of the great struggle of the Netherlands for religious and
    political independence from the yoke of Spain and the Inquisition
    was not propitious for the fostering of the Fine Arts. Not only did
    the troubled provinces, as was quite natural, slacken in artistic
    production, but a vast portion of the treasures owned by churches
    and monastic establishments were destroyed by the fanaticism of
    Protestant iconoclasts. The separation of the Protestant North from
    the Catholic South by the Utrecht Union in 1579 became in a way the
    determining factor for the future course of painting in Holland and
    in the Belgic provinces. The Dutchmen practically had no further use
    for religious painting, and devoted themselves more exclusively to the
    domestic genre, portraiture, and landscape; whilst the Flemings applied
    themselves largely to infusing new vitality into the representation
    of Scriptural characters and incidents which, through constant
    mechanical repetition, had become mere allegorical hieroglyphics, or
    generalised ideas without the all-important sense of pulsating life.
    This regeneration was the great deed of Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640),
    who, whilst still benefiting from the example of the great Italians,
    remained the very embodiment of Flemish character and thought, and
    became the founder of the second important period of Flemish national
    art. He was a man of exuberant vitality and boundless energy, endowed
    with a creative force unequalled in the whole history of art. He must
    rank for all time among the very giants of the brush, with Rembrandt,
    Titian, and Velazquez, his contribution to the progress in pictorial
    art being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> the use of pigment and sweeping brushwork as a constructive
    element—an advance as significant as the Venetians’ admission of
    light into the pictorial scheme, which with the Florentines was based
    entirely on linear design.</p>

  <h3 id="PIETER_BRUEGHEL">PIETER BRUEGHEL</h3>

  <p>But before considering the magnificent array of close on fifty
    authentic works by the master which form part of the French national
    collection, reference will have to be made to a few Flemish artists
    of the singularly barren decades that precede the advent of Rubens.
    First and foremost among these is Pieter Brueghel (or Breughel) the
    Elder (1530–1569), who was born at Breda in 1530, became a pupil of
    Pieter Koeck, and died at Brussels in 1569. In spite of his early
    travels in Italy—which were then already considered indispensable for
    the completion of an artist’s training—he remained unaffected by the
    all-pervading Italian influence. He was pure Flemish in thought and
    expression, and devoted himself to the realistic painting of peasant
    life. Certain realistic features which make his pictures sometimes
    appear obscene and coarse to modern eyes are merely an expression of
    the humour of his age. The exquisite little painting, <cite>The Beggars</cite>
    (No. 1917), which is fully signed</p>

  <div class="center small">PETER BRUEGHEL, M D L VIII,</div>

  <p class="noindent">is probably some satirical political allusion to the
    revolutionary party who called themselves the <cite>Gueux</cite> (beggars). A
    similar political significance is probably the intention of <cite>The
    Parable of the Blind</cite> (No. 1917<span class="smcap">a</span>). The single file of blind
    men following their blind leaders into a river is meant to satirise
    the moral blindness of the artist’s compatriots following their
    political leaders into disaster. This excellent version of Brueghel’s
    famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> masterpiece at Naples was bought at the Leys sale at Antwerp,
    in 1894, for £724. The type of picture to which the elder Brueghel
    owes his sobriquet “Peasant Brueghel” is exemplified at the Louvre
    by two little panels, <cite>A Village</cite> (No. 1918) and <cite>Peasants Dancing</cite>
    (No. 1918<span class="smcap">a</span>), which can, however, only be accepted as school
    pictures.</p>

  <h3 id="JAN_BRUEGHEL">JAN BRUEGHEL</h3>

  <p>Of Brueghel’s two sons, Pieter the younger, known as “Hell” Brueghel,
    is not represented at the Louvre, which, on the other hand, boasts
    possession of eight examples from the brush of “Peasant” Brueghel’s
    second son, Jan (1568–1625), known to fame as “Velvet” Brueghel, either
    owing to his love of splendid apparel or to the velvety softness of his
    brush. He began as a still-life and flower painter, in which capacity
    he often collaborated with Rubens. Having journeyed to Rome in 1593, he
    devoted himself more exclusively to landscape enlivened with many small
    figures, for which some Scriptural or mythological subject generally
    provided the excuse. Where his pictures contain figures on a larger
    scale, they are generally put in by Rubens, Rottenhammer, or Van Balen.
    The last-named is certainly responsible for the figures in <cite>Air</cite> (No.
    1920), one of a series of the Four Elements, painted by Jan Brueghel
    for his Roman patron, Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, in 1621. To the
    same series belongs <cite>Earth</cite>, or <cite>The Earthly Paradise</cite> (No. 1919), a
    subject often repeated by him, as for instance in the versions at The
    Hague and at Budapest. Of his other pictures at the Louvre <cite>The Bridge
    of Talavera</cite> (No. 1925), and the <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 1926), are signed
    and dated <span class="smcap">brueghel</span>, 1619, and <span class="smcap">j. brueghel</span>, 1620,
    respectively. <cite>The Battle of Arbela</cite> (No. 1921) is a characteristic
    work with many minutely wrought figures. The <cite>Landscapes</cite> (Nos. 1923
    and 1924) are of doubtful authenticity, and were formerly attributed to
    Paul Bril. They are not now exhibited.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>There are scarcely any Flemish characteristics in the art of Paul
    Bril (1556–1626), the younger brother and pupil of Matthias Bril. He
    was born at Antwerp, but worked nearly all his life in Rome. There is
    little to distinguish this precursor of Poussin in the art of landscape
    from his Italian contemporaries. In <cite>Duck Shooting</cite> (No. 1908), <cite>Diana
    and her Nymphs</cite> (No. 1909), and <cite>Pan and Syrinx</cite> (No. 1911) the figures
    are believed to have been painted in by Annibale Carracci. <cite>The
    Fishermen</cite> (No. 1910) bears his signature <span class="smcap">pa. brilli</span>, and the
    date 1624.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_FRANCK_FAMILY">THE FRANCK FAMILY</h3>

  <p>Although the Louvre owns no picture by Frans Floris, the head of the
    Italianising mid-sixteenth-century Antwerp school, his uninteresting
    style may be studied in <cite>The Story of Esther</cite> (No. 1989) by his pupil
    Frans Franck (1542–1616). To that second-rate artist’s son, Frans
    Franck the Younger (1581–1642), who already benefited to a certain
    extent by the example of Rubens, is given in the official Catalogue
    <cite>Ulysses recognising Achilles among the Daughters of Lycomedes</cite> (No.
    1991<span class="smcap">a</span>). <cite>The Parable of the Prodigal Son</cite> (No. 1990), which is
    also catalogued under his name, is obviously by his son Frans Franck
    <span class="smcap">iii.</span>, since the date 1663 precedes the signature, and F.
    Franck the younger died in 1642.</p>

  <p>Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569–1622) was born at Antwerp, but spent
    the later part of his life in Paris, where, like his father, he enjoyed
    considerable reputation as a portrait painter. He had previously been
    working at the Mantuan Court, and became painter to Marie de Médicis
    after 1609. Although he occasionally produced altarpieces like the
    rather uninspired <cite>Last Supper</cite> (No. 2068) and <cite>St. Francis receiving
    the Stigmata</cite> (No. 2069), he was essentially a portrait painter. In
    this capacity he belongs rather to the age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> that was coming to a close
    than to the new era initiated by Rubens. His portraits are quite
    soundly painted, rich in colour, and convincing as likenesses, but lack
    depth of character and suavity of touch. By far his best pictures at
    the Louvre are the <cite>Portrait of Henri IV.</cite> (No. 2071) and the large
    <cite>Portrait of Marie de Médicis</cite> (No. 2072), in which the details of
    the costume are particularly noteworthy. Less important is another
    <cite>Portrait of Henri IV.</cite> (No. 2070), and one of <cite>Guillaume du Vair</cite> (No.
    2074).</p>

  <p>Octavius van Veen, or Otto Venius (1558–1629), the painter of <cite>The
    Artist and his Family</cite> (No. 2191), owes his fame more to the fact that
    he was one of the three masters under whom Rubens studied than to any
    intrinsic merit of his art.</p>

  <h3 id="PETER_PAUL_RUBENS">PETER PAUL RUBENS</h3>

  <p>The Louvre owes its almost unequalled wealth in paintings by Rubens to
    the master’s relations with Marie de Médicis and her Court; and to this
    reason is due the fact that by far the largest portion of the fifty-one
    authentic works wholly or partly from his brush, which now form part of
    this great collection, date approximately from, or immediately before
    and after, the time during which he was busy with the famous series
    painted by order of that queen for the decoration of the Luxembourg
    Palace, and now to be seen in a setting appropriate to their florid
    sumptuousness in the new Rubens Gallery at the Louvre. Even so, the
    collection comprises examples of every phase of the master’s colossal
    activity—religious and historical compositions, allegorical paintings,
    landscapes, portraits, still life, and even <i lang="fr">genre</i>-pieces, like the
    <cite>Kermesse</cite> (No. 2115), in which he successfully competes with Teniers
    on a ground peculiarly his own.</p>

  <p>Born at Siegen in 1577, Rubens received his artistic education at
    Antwerp from Tobias Verhaecht, a landscape painter, Adam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> van Noort,
    and O. van Veen. At the age of twenty-three he went to Italy and
    entered the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, studying in their
    own country the works of the great Italian masters, and especially the
    Venetians, from whose glorious colour he derived more benefit than
    from his early training. With the exception of a journey to the Court
    of Philip III. at Madrid, where he was sent on a mission by the Duke
    of Mantua in 1603, Rubens spent the eight years from 1600 to 1608 in
    the various Italian centres, and especially in Rome, where he painted,
    about 1606, the little <cite>Landscape with Ruins</cite> (No. 2119), which is
    of interest not only as showing to what degree he was at that time
    influenced by the Roman school, and by the Carracci, but also as being
    the very first landscape known to have been produced by him. The same
    view of the Palatine Hill is to be recognised in the background of
    the <cite>Four Philosophers</cite> at the Pitti Palace, and in the portrait of
    Woverius in the Arenberg collection. Of about the same time, though the
    figures would appear to have been added at a considerably later date,
    is the <cite>Landscape with a Rainbow</cite> (No. 2118).</p>

  <h3 id="RUBENS_AT_ANTWERP">RUBENS AT ANTWERP</h3>

  <p>Having returned to Antwerp in 1608, and married his first wife,
    Isabella Brant, in the following year, Rubens, who was now made Court
    painter to Archduke Albrecht, entered upon a period of stupendous
    artistic activity, which extended to about 1621, when he began to
    divide his time between art and diplomatic missions, and, having
    previously organised a vast studio with an army of assistants, often
    left the execution of his brilliant sketch designs to less capable
    hands. This early Antwerp period is not particularly well represented
    at the Louvre, although the collection includes <cite>The Virgin surrounded
    by the Holy Innocents</cite> (No. 2078)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>— a Virgin of characteristic
    Flemish coarseness and fulness of form, in the midst of a dense swarm
    of delicious, plump, dimpled, wingless angel-children, whose rosy
    baby-flesh is painted with inimitable mastery. The picture was painted
    about 1615, six years before <cite>The Virgin and Child within a Garland of
    Flowers</cite> (No. 2079), executed in 1621 for Cardinal Federigo Borromeo.
    The tasteless floral wreath in this picture, as in the similar versions
    at Munich and New York, is from the brush of Jan Brueghel. To about
    the year 1615 belongs also the <cite>Christ on the Cross, with the Virgin,
    the Magdalen and St. John</cite> (No. 2082), which can, however, hardly be
    entirely from the master’s own hand. The mass of unbroken vermilion
    in the robe of St. John is one of Rubens’s favourite devices at that
    period. <cite>The Resurrection of Lazarus</cite> (No. 2081) is the original sketch
    for the Berlin picture.</p>

  <p>In 1620, when Rubens undertook to paint a series of thirty-nine
    <cite>Miracles of SS. Ignatius Loyola and François Xavier</cite> for the ceiling
    of the Jesuit Church at Antwerp, the business-like organisation of his
    studio was an acknowledged fact, as may be gathered from the terms of
    the agreement which stipulated that the master himself should provide
    the designs, though the execution was to be entrusted to his most
    competent assistants. The actual paintings were destroyed by fire in
    1718, but of the original sketches seventeen have been preserved, and
    are now distributed between the Louvre, the Vienna Academy, the Museums
    of Gotha and Brussels, and the Dulwich Gallery. The four in the La Caze
    collection at the Louvre are <cite>Abraham’s Sacrifice</cite> (No. 2120), <cite>Abraham
    and Melchisedek</cite> (No. 2121), <cite>The Elevation of the Cross</cite> (No. 2122),
    and <cite>The Coronation of the Virgin</cite> (No. 2123). The whole series, but
    especially the first two of these, is remarkable for the boldness of
    the foreshortening, calculated for the position of the panels on the
    ceiling, and for the swift bravura and inimitable expressiveness of the
    brushwork. To the same period belongs <cite>Philopœmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> recognised by an Old
    Woman</cite> (No. 2124), which is essentially a brilliant still-life study
    for a lost picture.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_MEDICIS_SERIES">THE MÉDICIS SERIES</h3>

  <p>We come now to the series of twenty-one large allegorical paintings,
    designed by Rubens and executed mostly by his pupils, from 1621 to
    1625, for the decoration of the Luxembourg Palace for Marie de Médicis,
    whose by no means inspiring career had to furnish the subjects for
    the series. It was a thankless task which could only be accomplished
    by a <i lang="fr">tour de force</i>—by removing the events of the queen’s life from
    actuality into the sphere of mythology and allegory. That the strange
    mingling of the real and the ideal should sometimes verge on the
    grotesque was almost inevitable—as inevitable as that the work of
    his assistants should have failed to do full justice to the master’s
    conception, even if it was “pulled together” by the easily recognisable
    touches added by Rubens to the finished panels. The florid exuberance
    of design and colour was entirely in keeping with the purpose and the
    surroundings for which the paintings were intended. It is impossible
    here to enter into a full description of this extensive series, or
    to define exactly Rubens’s share in each of the eleven pictures. We
    must confine ourselves to the brief enumeration of the subjects in
    the order in which they are now to be seen in the new Rubens Gallery.
    The series begins with <cite>The Fates spinning the Destiny of Marie de
    Médicis</cite> (No. 2085). Then follow <cite>The Triumph of Truth</cite> (No. 2105);
    <cite>Henri IV. receiving the Portrait of Marie</cite> (No. 2088); <cite>The Marriage
    of Marie by Procuration with Henri IV.</cite> (No. 2089); <cite>Marie landing at
    Marseilles, Nov. 3, 1600</cite> (No. 2090); <cite>The Marriage at Lyons, Dec. 10,
    1600</cite> (No. 2091); <cite>The Birth of Louis XIII. at Fontainebleau, Sept.
    27, 1601</cite> (No. 2092); <cite>Henri IV. leaves for the War with Germany and
    entrusts the Government to the Queen</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> (No. 2093, <a href="#i_plate21">Plate XXI.</a>); <cite>The
    Coronation of the Queen</cite> (No. 2094); <cite>Apotheosis of Henri IV. and the
    Queen’s Regency</cite> (No. 2095); <cite>The Queen’s Journey to Ponts-de-Cé</cite> (No.
    2097); <cite>Exchange of the Two Princesses, Nov. 9, 1615</cite> (No. 2098); <cite>The
    Prosperous Regency</cite> (No. 2099); <cite>The Majority of Louis XIII.</cite> (No.
    2100); <cite>The Queen’s Nocturnal Flight from Blois</cite> (No. 2101); <cite>The
    Reconciliation of the Queen with her Son</cite> (No. 2102); <cite>The Conclusion
    of Peace</cite> (No. 2103); and <cite>Marie’s Interview with her Son</cite> (No. 2104).
    But <cite>The Birth of Marie de Médicis, at Florence, on April 26, 1575</cite>
    (No. 2086); <cite>The Education of Marie by Minerva, Mercury, Apollo, and
    the Graces</cite> (No. 2087); and <cite>The Gods in Olympus protecting the Queen’s
    Government</cite> (No. 2096), which belong to the same series, have been
    placed in another room.</p>

  <p>Of the first and the last paintings the Louvre owns the original
    sketch on one panel, by Rubens, for <cite>The Triumph of Truth</cite> and <cite>The
    Fates spinning the Destiny of Marie</cite> (No. 2110), the other preliminary
    sketches being at the Hermitage and the Munich Gallery. It is
    interesting to note that all these sketches are designed in a very
    light key, almost in grisaille, with touches of rose and other tender
    colour notes, so that apparently Rubens’s assistants were allowed great
    liberty in the matter of colour.</p>

  <h3 id="MEDICIS_PORTRAITS">MÉDICIS PORTRAITS</h3>

  <p>Several other pictures by Rubens at the Louvre—all of them
    portraits—are more or less directly connected with the Médicis series,
    and were painted between 1621 and 1625. These are the <cite>Portrait of
    Anne of Austria</cite> (No. 2112), which was formerly known as <cite>Elizabeth of
    Bourbon</cite>; the <cite>Portrait of Francesco de’ Medici</cite> (No. 2106), Grand Duke
    of Tuscany, and father of Marie de Médicis, which was painted for the
    Luxembourg Gallery; the <cite>Portrait of Johanna of Austria</cite> (No. 2107),
    daughter of the Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> Ferdinand, and wife of Francesco de’ Medici;
    the <cite>Portraits of Marie de Médicis</cite> (Nos. 2108 and 2109) (the former in
    the character of Bellona, and both studio works with the final touches
    added by the master); and the <cite>Portrait of Baron Henri de Vicq</cite> (No.
    2111), who, as Flemish Ambassador to the French Court, was instrumental
    in procuring Rubens the important commission for the Luxembourg
    pictures. This admirable portrait was bought at the King of Holland’s

    It is a design of carefully studied rhythm, dramatic expressiveness,
    and subtly harmonised colour, carried out with the swift sureness of
    his later work.</p>

  <p>In 1627, a year before his mission to Spain on behalf of the Infanta
    Isabella, widow of the Archduke Albrecht, Rubens designed for his
    patroness an important series of tapestries, which were, as was his
    wont at that period, sketched out by him, executed by his assistants,
    and touched up by his own hand. The tapestries were subsequently
    presented by the Infanta to a convent at Madrid; some of the paintings
    for them perished by fire, others were preserved at the Convent of
    Loeches, near Madrid. Two of these, <cite>The Prophet Elijah in the Desert</cite>
    (No. 2076) and <cite>The Triumph of Religion</cite> (No. 2083), were part of
    General Sebastiani’s loot from Spain, and were bought by the Louvre for
    £2400; whilst four <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>others, now at Grosvenor House, were bought
    by the Marquis of Westminster for £10,500. Of about the same date is
    the brilliant <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite> (No. 2077), with its Titianesque
    scheme of strong red, blue, and golden yellow, of which a replica is in
    an Irish private collection.</p>

  <p>The closing decade of Rubens’s life is represented by five pictures
    of considerable importance. Of <cite>Queen Tomyris with the Head of Cyrus</cite>
    (No. 2084) there is an earlier, large, and deservedly famous version in
    Lord Darnley’s collection; but the Louvre picture exceeds it in beauty
    of design and in unity of colour. It was painted about the same time
    (<i>cca.</i> 1632) as <cite>Religion crowned by a Genius</cite> (No. 2126), one of the
    sketches for the ceiling at Whitehall. Of peculiar interest, owing to
    its unfinished state which reveals the master’s method of portraiture,
    is the superb portrait group of <cite>Hélène Fourment, the Artist’s Second
    Wife, and Two of her Children</cite> (No. 2113, <a href="#i_plate22">Plate XXII.</a>). Only the heads,
    which are remarkable for an intensity of expression that is rarely to
    be found in Rubens’s paintings, are finished. All the rest is loosely
    and thinly sketched in sepia heightened with swift touches of brighter
    colour. It was painted about 1636, which is also the approximate date
    of <cite>A Flemish Kermesse</cite> (No. 2115), an almost unique instance of the
    master applying the exuberant energy of his magic brush to a subject in
    which the expression of intense vitality and full-blooded sensuousness
    assumes the aspect almost of bestiality—which, however, in no way
    detracts from the artistic value of the painting. To turn from this to
    <cite>A Joust by the Moat of a Castle</cite> (No. 2116) is to pass from coarse
    realism to pure romanticism, inspired probably by the associations of
    the picturesque Castle of Steen, which Rubens had bought in 1635, and
    which forms the setting for this scene of knightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> prowess. This, and
    the marvellous and strangely modern little <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2117), in
    which the morning sun is seen rising from the autumnal mist, belong to
    the closing years of Rubens’s life. He died at Antwerp on May 20, 1640.</p>

  <h3 id="ANTHONY_VAN_DYCK">ANTHONY VAN DYCK</h3>

  <p>Born at Antwerp in 1599, Anthony van Dyck (1599–1641), after having
    worked a few years under Hendrick van Balen, entered Rubens’s
    studio in 1615, and soon became so conversant with the method of
    his famous master, that he was at an early age entrusted with the
    execution of important designs. Before he had reached his twentieth
    year he was a member of the Guild of St. Luke, and had acquired a
    reputation second only to that of Rubens himself. The <cite>Portraits of
    Jean Grusset Richardot, President of the Netherlands Council, and
    his Son</cite> (No. 1985), which was bought in 1784 for 16,001 <i>livres</i>,
    so closely resembles the work of Rubens, especially in the brilliant
    flesh-painting, that the picture—a posthumous portrait, by the way—for
    a long time passed under the elder master’s name, although it is now
    admitted by the best authorities to be an early picture by Van Dyck.</p>

  <p>Van Dyck paid a short visit to England in 1620. He went to Italy in the
    following year, studying the works of the great masters, and especially
    of Titian, and finally settling in Genoa, where he remained until his
    return to Antwerp in 1628. During these years he devoted himself almost
    exclusively to portraiture, in which he endeavoured successfully to
    emulate the golden warmth of colour which had drawn him towards Titian.
    Unfortunately this, to some the most attractive, phase of Van Dyck’s
    art is but indifferently shown at the Louvre, the only example being a
    <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 1976).</p>

    <h3 id="VAN_DYCKS_SECOND_ANTWERP_PERIOD">VAN DYCK’S SECOND ANTWERP PERIOD</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Some of the master’s most precious works at the Louvre belong to his
    second Antwerp period, which extended from his return from Genoa in
    1628 to his departure for England in 1632. It was probably then that he
    painted <cite>The Virgin and Child, with the Penitent Sinners</cite> (No. 1961)
    (Mary Magdalen, David, and the Prodigal Son), in which the influence of
    the Venetian colourists is so clearly to be noticed. Indeed, the bosom
    of the female penitent is copied from the nymph in Titian’s <cite>Education
    of Cupid</cite> at the Borghese Gallery, of which there is a drawing in the
    Chatsworth Sketch-book with the comment in the artist’s handwriting,
    “<i lang="fr">quel admirabil petto</i>.” Shortly after his return from Italy he
    also painted <cite>The Virgin and Child with Donors</cite> (No. 1962), one of
    his greatest masterpieces. The Madonna is of a youthful, pure type,
    vastly different from the buxom Flemish women so often depicted by his
    master in saintly characters. The painting of the Infant’s body is as
    admirable as that of the kneeling Donors, and a spiritual connection is
    established by the action of the Child and the expression of the man
    towards whom He is holding out His hand.</p>

  <p>The companion groups <cite>A Gentleman and a Child</cite> (No. 1973) and <cite>A Lady
    and her Daughter</cite> (No. 1974), date from about 1630. They are full of
    that aristocratic distinction which is the hall-mark of Van Dyck’s
    Genoese portraits, and which in his later English period was apt to
    degenerate into effeminacy. This air of distinction is also to be noted
    in the children, although they are perfectly natural in action and
    expression, and have none of that stiffness which makes so many of the
    earlier masters’ portraits of children look like undergrown men and
    women. The imposing equestrian portrait of <cite>Francisco d’Aytona, Marqués
    de Moncada</cite> (No. 1971), Generalissimus of the Spanish troops in the
    Netherlands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> which in its general disposition recalls the portrait of
    Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span> at Windsor Castle; the small study for it of the
    same sitter’s head and shoulders (No. 1972); and the portrait of <cite>The
    Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Regent of the Netherlands</cite> (No. 1970),
    in the costume of the Sisters of St. Clare, whom she had joined after
    the death of her husband the Archduke Albrecht, belong to the same
    period. Then also was painted the <cite>Rinaldo in the Garden of Armida</cite>
    (No. 1966), which is probably the picture bought from the artist at
    Antwerp by Endymion Porter, on behalf of King Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>, in
    March 1629, for the price of £78.</p>

  <h3 id="LE_ROI_A_LA_CHASSE">“LE ROI À LA CHASSE”</h3>

  <p>Van Dyck’s manner of life in England, as the petted Court painter of
    Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>, and the factory-like output of his well-organised
    studio at Blackfriars, are too well known to need further comment. In
    justice to his fair fame it is necessary to draw a clear distinction
    between the innumerable replicas turned out by his assistants under his
    guidance, and such magnificent original works from the master’s own
    brush as the glorious <cite>Portrait of King Charles I. of England</cite> (No.
    1967, <a href="#i_plate23">Plate XXIII.</a>), known as “<cite>Le Roi à la Chasse</cite>,” which is one of
    the proudest possessions of the French national collection. The king
    is seen, resting his gloved hand on a stick, in a glade, with the sea
    in the distance. Behind him are two attendants and his white charger
    pawing the ground in impatient action. The king’s noble, quiet dignity
    is such as to dominate the entire composition, without, however, the
    slightest hint of the theatrical. Here, as in most of his English
    portraits, Van Dyck has departed from the glowing sumptuousness of his
    earlier Venetian palette, and arrived at a cooler, mellow, and more
    personal harmony of decorative colour. As if conscious of the superior
    merit of this picture, which is more than a mere portrait <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>of the
    king, and depicts the very personification of royalty, the artist, who
    was not in the habit of signing his pictures, inscribed on a stone the
    lettering</p>

  <div class="center small">CAROLUS I REX MAGNÆ BRITANNIÆ · VAN DIICK F.</div>

  <p class="noindent">Painted for the king in 1635 for £100, it passed through

    are catalogued under Van Dyck’s name, but they are either of minor
    importance, or, like the <cite>Three Children of Charles I.</cite> (No. 1968),
    mere studio repetitions.</p>

  <h3 id="FRANS_SNYDERS">FRANS SNYDERS</h3>

  <p>The powerful personality of Rubens dominated the art of Flanders
    during the seventeenth century. His direct or indirect influence is
    traceable in the art of most of his contemporaries and of the painters
    of the next generation, who divided his artistic heritage without
    attaining to his universality. Thus his collaborator Frans Snyders
    (1579–1657), after studying under “Hell Brueghel” and H. van Balen,
    acquired the bravura of his brushwork and his unrivalled skill in
    depicting animals in violent movement from Rubens, in whose pictures
    of the chase he frequently painted the animals, whilst he often had to
    seek the assistance of other painters for the figures introduced into
    his own compositions. Among the thirteen pictures from his brush at
    the Louvre (Nos. 2141–2153) the <cite>Wild Boar Hunt</cite> (No. 2144) serves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
    best to illustrate Snyders’s power to suggest the furious onrush and
    wild excitement of the chase. His skill as a still-life painter may be
    judged from the masterly treatment of the wet glittering fish in the
    large <cite>Fish Merchants</cite> (No. 2145).</p>

  <h3 id="JACOB_JORDAENS">JACOB JORDAENS</h3>

  <p>Whatever appears coarse in the art of Rubens is accentuated to the
    point of grossness in the paintings by his fellow-student under Van
    Noort, Jacob Jordaens (1593–1678). He is the painter of <cite>Le Roi boit</cite>
    (No. 2014) or <cite>The Twelfth Night Feast</cite>, which is by no means the best
    of his many versions of his favourite subject. He was a realist who, as
    may be seen from this picture and from the <cite>Concert after a Meal</cite> (No.
    2015), found his most congenial subjects in the carousals of Flemish
    merrymakers, which he depicted with more than a touch of coarse humour.
    That his temperament and limitations debarred him from achieving
    success in the higher flights of art is clearly shown by his large but
    by no means noble canvas <cite>Christ driving the Moneylenders from the
    Temple</cite> (No. 2011). On the other hand, his firm grasp of character
    stood him in good stead in portraiture. The so-called <cite>Portrait of
    Admiral de Ruyter</cite> (No. 2016), which was bought in 1824 for £800, is a
    good example.</p>

  <p>We can only briefly refer to a number of seventeenth-century Antwerp
    painters, who were either pupils of Rubens or close followers of his
    tradition. Gonzales Coques (1614–1684), the painter of the admirably
    lighted <cite>Family Party</cite> (No. 1952), was essentially a portrait painter
    who became known as “the little Van Dyck,” although his manner had more
    in common with that of the Dutch “small masters” than with the tempered
    elegance of Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span>’s Court-painter.</p>

  <div>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
    <h3 id="FOLLOWERS_OF_RUBENS">FOLLOWERS OF RUBENS</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Gaspar de Crayer (1584–1669), a pupil of Raphael van Coxie, modelled
    his art entirely on Rubens, and was equally successful as a portrait
    painter and in his religious compositions. Both phases of his art
    figure in the Louvre collection, which owns the <cite>St. Augustin in
    Ecstasy</cite> (No. 1953) and the life-size <cite>Equestrian Portrait of the
    Infante Ferdinand, Governor of the Netherlands</cite> (No. 1954). It was a
    portrait of the same sitter that led to Crayer’s appointment to the
    position of Painter to the Infante’s Court, accompanied by considerable
    emoluments.</p>

  <p>Abraham van Diepenbeeck (1596–1675), Pieter van Mol (1599–1650), and
    Paul de Vos (1593–1676) need not here detain us. They are all capable
    followers of their master’s style, without any personal distinction.
    David Ryckaert (1612–1661), the third of four artists of the same
    family that bore this name, is outside the immediate circle of Rubens.
    His <cite>Interior of a Studio</cite> (No. 2137), which bears the signature
    “<span class="smcap">d. ryc.</span> f. 1638,” is of peculiar interest as a document
    illustrating the <i lang="fr">milieu</i> in which a Flemish artist of that period
    lived and worked.</p>

  <p>Gerard Seghers (1591–1651), the painter of <cite>St. Francis in Ecstasy</cite>
    (No. 2140), although a pupil of Van Balen and Abraham Janssens, and
    indirectly, through Manfredi, of Caravaggio, must be counted among
    those who were influenced by the dominating personality of Rubens. An
    important pupil of Snyders was Jan Fyt (1611–1661), who excelled as
    an animal painter and colourist. He was at his best when he treated
    animals more in the manner of still life, but remained vastly inferior
    to his master when he tried to emulate his hunting scenes. Not all the
    five pictures catalogued under his name can be accepted as his own
    work. His great skill in rendering the varied textures of furs and
    feathers may be judged from <cite>Game in a Larder</cite> (No. 1993), which is
    unquestionably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> authentic although it does not bear the signature which
    testifies to his authorship of <cite>A Dog devouring Game</cite> (No. 1994).</p>

  <h3 id="ADRIAEN_BROUWER">ADRIAEN BROUWER</h3>

  <p>Both the Flemish school and the Dutch have an equal right to claim
    Adriaen Brouwer (1605 or 6–1638), who, born at Oudenarde, carried on
    the tradition of Bouts and the elder Brueghel. While still young,
    he was at Haarlem powerfully impressed by the art of Frans Hals,
    although it is extremely doubtful that he ever actually worked in his
    studio. Finally, having settled at Antwerp in 1631, he benefited by
    the example of Rubens. <cite>The Smoker</cite> (No. 1916), in spite of the doubts
    that have been cast upon it, is a characteristic work of his at the
    time when, inspired by Frans Hals, he adopted a full impasto instead
    of his earlier glazes. It is signed with his initials “<span class="smcap">ab</span>”
    in the bottom corner on the right. The handling is far coarser
    than that of the later <cite>Interior of a Tavern</cite> (No. 1912), which is
    quite Rembrandtesque in the rendering of light and chiaroscuro. His
    inclination towards grimacing expression often made him depict such
    scenes as <cite>The Operation</cite> (No. 1915), in which the patient’s face is
    contorted with pain, while the surgeon is bandaging his left shoulder.</p>

  <p>Brouwer was the master of Joos van Craesbeeck (1606–1654?), who not
    only closely followed his teaching, but actually painted many replicas
    of Brouwer’s pictures which still pass under the better known artist’s
    name. <cite>The Artist painting a Portrait</cite> (No. 1952<span class="smcap">d</span>) was
    supposed to represent, and to be from the brush of, Brouwer, when the
    picture was bought for the Louvre. But on technical grounds it must be
    given to Craesbeeck—quite apart from the extreme improbability that
    the dissolute Brouwer, who spent most of his time in low taverns,
    should have lived in the elegant, not to say luxurious, surroundings
    here depicted, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> died young. There can be no doubt that the painter
    seated before his easel, to whom a man-servant is offering a glass of
    wine, is Joos van Craesbeeck.</p>

  <h3 id="DAVID_TENIERS">DAVID TENIERS</h3>

  <p>There is at the Louvre no picture by the elder David Teniers
    (1582–1649), who therefore only interests us here as the father and
    first master of the much greater artist David Teniers the Younger
    (1610–1690), who completed his artistic education under Rubens,
    without, however, abdicating his own personality. Indeed, those of
    his pictures which reflect the manner of Rubens too closely are of
    little account in the achievement of the younger Teniers, who only
    begins to be himself when he devotes his prolific brush to the social
    life of his contemporaries, and especially of the lower classes. His
    pictures constitute the most realistic and convincing record of the
    tastes, manners, and amusements of his time. His types are full of
    character, but without the exaggerations so often found in Brueghel and
    Brouwer. What he retained of Rubens, even in his Village Fêtes, Tavern
    Scenes, Dances, and Carousals is the application of the great master’s
    principles of light and harmonious colour. But apart from this, he
    rejected the “grand style” and the conscious search for beauty. The
    ugliness of his types and gestures led Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> to exclaim
    in front of his pictures, “<i lang="fr">Ôtez-moi ces magots-là!</i>”</p>

  <p>Few painters are as exhaustively represented at the Louvre as the
    younger Teniers. The Catalogue includes no fewer than thirty-nine
    entries under his name, two of which, in the La Caze collection
    (Nos. 2189 and 2190), are copies after pictures by Lotto and Titian
    respectively in the collection of the Archduke Leopold William,
    Governor of the Netherlands, to whom Teniers was appointed Court
    painter. It would serve no purpose here to enumerate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> the long list
    of Kermesse, Village Fête, and Alehouse Scenes in the French national
    collection. Among his most deservedly famous masterpieces is <cite>The
    Return of the Prodigal Son</cite> (No. 2156), which belongs to a series of
    which another scene is to be seen at the Dulwich Gallery. The subject
    is really only a thinly veiled excuse for the painting of a <i lang="fr">genre</i>
    piece of the contemporary life of the better classes of his country.
    The scene of the feast is laid outside a country inn that figures in
    many of Teniers’s pictures. Fully signed, and dated 1644, the picture
    belongs to the beginning of Teniers’s very best period. In <cite>The
    Temptation of St. Anthony</cite> (No. 2158) he rivals Bosch in the invention
    of grotesquely fantastic monsters. Among other important works by the
    master in the Louvre must be mentioned <cite>The Denial of St. Peter</cite> (No.
    2155), a painting of exquisite silvery quality, signed and dated</p>

  <div class="center small lh2">DAVID TENIERS, f. AN. 1646;</div>

  <p class="noindent"><cite>The Works of Mercy</cite> (No. 2157); the <cite>Village Fête</cite> (No.
    2159); and the <cite>Peasants dancing by an Inn Door</cite> (No. 2161), which was
    stolen from the collection in 1815 and returned in the following year
    with a letter explaining that it had been removed by a Frenchman who
    feared that it might fall into the hands of the Allied Forces.</p>

  <p>By Teniers’s pupil, François Duchatel (1616?–1694?) is the excellent
    <cite>Portrait of a Gentleman</cite> (No. 1960). Duchatel is a very rare master,
    whose style in portraiture so closely resembles that of Gonzales Coques
    that his pictures have been at times ascribed to that painter. Jacob
    van Artois (1613–1684?), the painter of the <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 1901) in
    the La Caze room, was one of the leading Flemish landscape painters
    of his time, and frequently collaborated with Teniers, who added the
    figures to some of his landscapes. He was the master of Cornelis
    Huysmans (1648–1727), who frequently assisted the battle painter,
    Van der Meulen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> is here represented by eight pictures (Nos.
    2002–2009). Among the landscape painters of that period must also be
    mentioned Jan Siberechts (1627–1703), who spent the closing years of
    his life in England, but does not seem to have had much influence on
    the evolution of the English landscape school. By him is the <cite>Rustic
    Scene</cite> (No. 2140<span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

  <h3 id="PHILIPPE_DE_CHAMPAIGNE">PHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE</h3>

  <p>Both Philippe de Champaigne (1602–1674) and Adam Frans van der Meulen
    (1634–1690), though born at Brussels, resided in France the best part
    of their life, and are therefore generally classed with the painters of
    the French school, which accounts for their being represented at the
    Louvre in a manner which is quite out of proportion to their artistic
    significance. Still, if Philippe de Champaigne appears second-rate when
    compared with Rubens and Van Dyck, he is unquestionably the leading
    portrait painter of the contemporary French school in which he received
    his training. His powers were insufficient for the higher flights of
    imagination, and when his ambition led him to such compositions as
    <cite>Christ in the House of Simon</cite> (No. 1927) or <cite>Christ celebrating Easter
    with His Disciples</cite> (No. 1928), he was as dull and bombastic as most
    of his French contemporaries, whom he far excelled as a colourist.
    His portraits, on the other hand, are painted in a broad, honest,
    straightforward manner which has nothing in common with the monotonous
    pompousness of his age, as may be seen from the admirable group of two
    nuns in prayer, <cite>Mother Catherine Agnes Arnaud and Sister Catherine de
    Sainte-Suzanne</cite> (No. 1934). The younger of the two nuns represents the
    artist’s daughter, who was healed from paralysis by a miracle recorded
    by a Latin inscription on the wall. The twenty pictures from Philippe
    de Champaigne’s brush, which are actually on view, also include
    the fine group of the two architects <cite>François<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> Mansard and Claude
    Perrault</cite> (No. 1944), bought in 1835 for the low price of £80; <cite>The
    Provost and Aldermen of Paris</cite> (No. 1945); and the signed and dated
    portrait of <cite>Robert Arnaud d’Andilly</cite> (No. 1939).</p>

  <h3 id="VAN_DER_MEULEN">VAN DER MEULEN</h3>

  <p>Van der Meulen, a native of Brussels and pupil of Snayers, was the
    historiographer of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>’s campaigns and victories. He
    was invited by Colbert to come to Paris, and was first employed to
    furnish designs for the Gobelins manufactory. Afterwards he accompanied
    Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> on his warlike expeditions, which he immortalised
    in numerous large paintings, most of which are now at the Louvre
    and in the Château at Versailles. His paintings are of considerable
    topographical interest, as they give accurate representations of the
    aspect of famous towns and fortresses in the seventeenth century,
    as in the <cite>Entry of Louis XIV. and Marie-Thérèse into Arras</cite> (No.
    2035), a similar scene at <cite>Douai</cite> (No. 2033), and the <cite>Arrival of
    the King in the Camp before Maastricht</cite> (No. 2040). It was Van der
    Meulen who founded the “tactical school” of battle painting, which
    substituted the orderly movement of masses for the wild mêlée of the
    hand-to-hand combat. Whole armies are seen advancing or retreating in
    long lines from a high vantage-ground which is generally occupied by
    the considerably larger figures of the army-leaders on rearing and
    caracoling horses, and looking for all the world like “<i lang="fr">gens de qualité
    qui joueraient aux échecs avec des soldats de plomb</i>.” The official
    Catalogue mentions no fewer than twenty pictures by Van der Meulen.</p>

  <h3 id="MINOR_FLEMISH_PAINTERS">MINOR FLEMISH PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>With the exception of Justus Sustermans (1597–1681), who was Van
    Dyck’s fellow-student under H. van Balen and afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> rose to great
    fame as Court painter to Grand-Duke Cosimo <span class="smcap">ii.</span> of Tuscany
    (whose kinsman <cite>Leopold de’ Medici</cite> is portrayed in No. 2154), and
    Pieter Neefs (1577?–1661?), whose <cite>Church Interiors</cite> (Nos. 2059–2064)
    are remarkable for the faultless accuracy and precision of his
    architectural drawing, there are no other painters of the Flemish
    school whose works at the Louvre require close attention. We must
    content ourselves with the mere mention of the landscape painters Jan
    Frans van Bloemen, called Orizonte, a follower of Poussin and Claude;
    Jan van Breda, Francisque Millet, and Mathys Schoevaerts; Carl van
    Falens and Anton Grief, painters of hunting scenes; Jan Miel, who
    worked most of his life in Italy and was completely influenced by
    the masters of that country; the still-life painter Gaspard Pieter
    Verbruggen; the battle painter Sebastiaen Francken; and the prolific
    painter of large altarpieces, Jacob van Oost the Elder. With Balthasar
    Paul Ommeganck (1755–1826) and the still-life painter Jan Frans van
    Dael (1764–1840) we reach the beginning of the nineteenth century,
    a period of absolute stagnation in Flemish art which preceded the
    brilliant revival of the modern Belgian school. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_GERMAN_SCHOOL">THE GERMAN SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">OF all the important European schools of painting, the Early German
    school is the one of which it is almost impossible to gain anything
    like an adequate idea from the pictures that have found their way into
    the Galleries of foreign countries. The fact is that with the exception
    of two or three leading masters, like Holbein and Dürer, the Early
    Germans found but scant favour beyond the confines of their own country
    until comparatively recent years—that is to say, until the majority
    of important examples had been systematically gathered in by the
    museums of Germany. Now that the importance of the German primitives
    and Early Renaissance painters has been generally recognised, it
    will be practically impossible to regain the lost ground and to fill
    up the serious gaps which prevent our forming an adequate idea of
    the evolution of German art in the museums of other countries. The
    Louvre is no exception to this rule. The numerical weakness of the
    German section is unfortunately not atoned for by the importance of
    the examples included, which, with but few exceptions, are of little
    artistic account.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances it would be useless to attempt a consecutive
    narrative of the evolution of German art as illustrated by the pictures
    at the Louvre, and we must confine ourselves to a brief discussion of
    the few noteworthy works in the collection.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_MASTER_OF_THE_BARTHOLOMEW_ALTAR">“THE MASTER OF THE BARTHOLOMEW ALTAR”</h3>

  <p>The first picture of importance belongs to the period when the idealism
    of the Early Gothic primitives was already replaced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> by a strong
    naturalism, and the creation of types by that of clearly characterised
    individualities. This picture, the <cite>Descent from the Cross</cite> (No. 2737),
    by the unknown “Master of the Bartholomew Altar,” is so called, in
    accordance with German custom, from his best known work, the great
    altarpiece in the Pinakothek at Munich. In the large Louvre picture,
    which bears a close resemblance to the precious little panel by the
    same master in the possession of the Hon. Edward Wood, at Temple
    Newsam, the Saviour is being lowered from the Cross by Nicodemus into
    the hands of one of the Holy Women on the left, and of Joseph of
    Arimathæa on the right. The group is completed by St. John supporting
    the Virgin on the extreme left, the Magdalen and another Holy Woman on
    the right, and a Disciple seated on a ladder above the central group.
    The figures are shown, as in the Temple Newsam painting of the same
    subject, against a gold background framed with rich Gothic tracery.
    This altarpiece is believed to be the last picture by this Cologne
    master, who flourished between 1490 and 1515, and was in his later
    manner influenced by Rogier van der Weyden and other Flemish masters.
    This eminently important Early German picture was painted for a Jesuit
    establishment in the rue St. Antoine, Paris, which accounts for its
    presence in the French national collection.</p>

  <h3 id="COLOGNE_PAINTERS">COLOGNE PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>The “Master of the Death of Mary,” to whose school belongs the <cite>Descent
    from the Cross</cite>, with a predella representing <cite>The Last Supper</cite>, and a
    lunette with <cite>St. Francis receiving the Stigmata</cite> (No. 2738), has been
    identified by Wauters and Aldenhoven with the early-sixteenth-century
    Flemish painter Joos van Cleef the Elder, and belongs to the Antwerp
    rather than the Cologne school. The “Master of St. Severin,” to whom
    the official Catalogue ascribes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> the two <cite>Scenes from the Life of
    St. Ursula</cite> (Nos. 2738<span class="smcap">c</span> and 2738<span class="smcap">d</span>), was probably a
    Flemish painter who worked at Cologne at the beginning of the sixteenth
    century. But the two panels at the Louvre, which were formerly at the
    Cluny Museum, are not from his brush. They are the work of his pupil,
    the “Master of the Ursula Legend,” and belong to a series of which
    other panels can be seen at the Victoria and Albert Museum and at
    Cologne.</p>

  <p>The first definite name in the annals of the Cologne school is
    that of Bartolomäus Bruyn (<i>c.</i> 1493–1555), who was a follower of
    Joos van Cleef but subsequently became completely imbued with the
    Italian spirit. His portraits, in which he remained more faithful to
    the tradition of his country, are of greater significance than his
    religious compositions, and closely resemble those by Joos van Cleef;
    but the <cite>Portrait of a Man with a White Cross on his Breast</cite> (No. 2702)
    is only a school picture of indifferent quality.</p>

  <h3 id="ALBRECHT_DURER">ALBRECHT DÜRER</h3>

  <p>The flourishing school which had its centre at Nuremberg is represented
    at the Louvre by the master who marks its zenith and who, if his
    craftsmanship was not always on a level with the perfection of
    Holbein’s, shares with the Augsburg master the honour of uncontested
    leadership of all German artists. Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was born
    at Nuremberg, of Hungarian descent. He studied his art under Michael
    Wohlgemut, a very able Nuremberg painter, who was, however, led by his
    popularity to factory-like production of pictures that passed under his
    name, although they were largely executed by inferior pupils. Dürer,
    who excelled equally as an engraver and as a painter, was, on the
    other hand, one of the most sincere and personal artists of his time—a
    profound thinker, a shrewd observer, a student of life in all its
    phases, an idealist who was ever striving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> for beautiful expression,
    even though the realistic tradition of his country did not allow him to
    attain to the abstract ideal of beauty which had been reached by some
    of the contemporary Italians. Indeed, Dürer may with justice be called
    the Leonardo of the North. He studied Venetian art on a visit to Venice
    in 1505, whither he had been preceded by his fame. He also travelled to
    the Netherlands in 1520, the year in which he painted the signed and
    dated <cite>Head of an Old Man</cite> (No. 2709), his other picture at the Louvre
    being the not very masterly <cite>Head of a Child</cite> (No. 2709<span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

  <h3 id="DURERS_FOLLOWERS">DÜRER’S FOLLOWERS</h3>

  <p>Dürer died in 1528 from a disease contracted during his journey to
    the Netherlands. Among his principal pupils were Georg Pencz (<i>c.</i>
    1500–1550), to whom is without sufficient reason attributed the
    indifferent half figure of <cite>St. John the Evangelist</cite> (No. 2730); and
    Hans Sebald Beham (<i>c.</i> 1500–1550), the famous engraver, of whom the
    Louvre is fortunate to possess the only known painting, a table top
    divided by golden lances into four compartments, each of which contains
    a <cite>Subject from the Story of David</cite> (No. 2701): the <cite>Entry of Saul
    into Jerusalem; David and Bathsheba</cite> (in which scene is introduced
    a portrait of Archbishop Albrecht of Mayence, for whom the work was
    executed); the <cite>Siege of Rabbath</cite>; and the <cite>Prophet Nathan before
    David</cite> (with a portrait of the artist and the initials of his name,
    “<span class="smcap">h. s. b.</span>”).</p>

  <h3 id="LUCAS_CRANACH">LUCAS CRANACH</h3>

  <p>This same Archbishop Albrecht, whose features are also known to us
    from two engravings by Dürer and a painting by Grünewald, was one of
    the most generous patrons of Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553),
    whose busy workshops at Witten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>berg supplied the whole north and east
    of Germany with portraits, altarpieces, historical and mythological
    pictures. Lucas Cranach was a follower of Grünewald, the great head of
    the Colmar school. Apart from his merit as a colourist and an excellent
    draughtsman, he attracts by the naïve grace of his nude figures and
    by the complete manner in which he reflects the taste of his time and
    country. But of the five little pictures that figure in the Louvre
    Catalogue under his name, not one is from his own hand. Indeed, the
    <cite>Venus in a Landscape</cite> (No. 2703) is the only one that may with a
    degree of safety be attributed to his son, Lucas Cranach the Younger,
    who carried on the management of the studio some years before his
    father’s death, and continued to imitate his style until his own death
    in 1586. The <cite>Venus</cite> bears the usual Cranach signature of a winged
    serpent and the date 1520. The same crest, with the date 1532, figures
    on the portrait of <cite>Johann Friedrich III., Elector of Saxony</cite> (No.
    2704), who is known on one occasion to have given a wholesale order
    of sixty replicas of the same portrait to the Wittenberg master. It
    may be imagined that a commission of this nature would not be executed
    by the head of the studio, but left to his staff of assistants. The
    <cite>Fighting Savages</cite> (No. 2702<span class="smcap">a</span>) and the two <cite>Portraits</cite> (Nos.
    2703<span class="smcap">a</span> and 2705) are, at the best, studio works.</p>

  <h3 id="HANS_HOLBEIN">HANS HOLBEIN</h3>

  <p>We now come to the second of the two commanding figures in German
    art, Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543), who was born at Augsburg
    and studied under his father, the elder artist of the same name. When
    he reached his maturity the Italian influence had already permeated
    German art, but he was the first Northern master who knew how to
    benefit by the real spirit of the Renaissance without imitating the
    letter; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> first to develop a noble, dignified style, free from the
    florid trivialities which so many Northerners took from certain Italian
    painters. He was above all a marvellous portrait painter who, in his
    drawings as well as in his paintings, combines the most exquisite
    delicacy and subtlety with rare strength, the greatest precision of
    detail with freedom and breadth of handling. Only this phase of his art
    is represented at the Louvre, which certainly owns one perfect example
    of Holbein’s portraiture in the <cite>Portrait of Erasmus</cite> (No. 2715, <a href="#i_plate24">Plate XXIV.</a>).</p>

  <p>Holbein had settled in Basle in 1519. He went to England in 1526, with
    a letter of introduction from Erasmus to Sir Thomas More. From one
    of Erasmus’s letters it would appear that Holbein had portrayed him
    at least three times before 1524; and the picture now in the Louvre
    was probably the one that was painted for Sir Thomas More—a better
    recommendation than any letter of introduction! The profile is drawn
    with inimitable mastery; and the whole character of the man can be read
    from the expression of the tight-pressed lips and mobile features, as
    he sits writing at his desk. Note, also, the marvellous expressiveness
    of the hands, studies for which are to be found in the collection of
    drawings at the Louvre.</p>

  <p>In view of the personal relations which link together Holbein, Erasmus,
    and Sir Thomas More, it would be pleasant if we could accept the
    so-called <cite>Portrait of Thomas More, Great Chancellor of England</cite> (No.
    2717), as authentic. It does not, however, represent Holbein’s first
    English patron, nor does it appear to be from the master’s own brush.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_KRATZER_PORTRAIT">THE KRATZER PORTRAIT</h3>

  <p>Holbein’s first sojourn in England extended from 1526 to 1528, in which
    year he returned to Basle. It must have been shortly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>before his
    departure that he painted the <cite>Portrait of Nicolas Kratzer, Astronomer
    to King Henry VIII.</cite> (No. 2713); it is an unquestionably authentic
    work, although it has been so extensively repainted that little is now
    left of the original, save the general disposition of the design and
    the instruments placed on the table and hung on the wall, which are
    executed with all the loving care that Holbein was wont to bestow upon
    such accessories. Still, even in its present condition, the portrait
    is a thoroughly convincing likeness of “a man who is brimful of wit,
    jest, and humorous fancies”—as Kratzer is referred to by one of his
    contemporaries. A sheet of paper on the left of the table appears to be
    inscribed:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">cannot without hesitation be accepted as an original work.
    It lacks, at any rate, the <i lang="fr">finesse</i> of the beautiful drawing at
    Windsor Castle, upon which it is evidently based.</p>

  <p>To the same year belongs the <cite>Portrait of Sir Richard Southwell</cite> (No.
    2719), to whose treacherous accusation was due the execution of Henry
    Howard, Earl of Surrey. But this picture, again, is only a replica, by
    an inferior hand, of the magnificent portrait in the Uffizi Gallery
    (No. 765). An inscription in the background, at both sides of the head,
    reads:</p>

    <div class="col50 right lh2">

    </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

  <p>It would thus appear that the picture was painted in 1537, the
    twenty-eighth year of Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span>’s reign. The <cite>Portrait of a
    Man holding a Carnation and a Rosary</cite> (No. 2720) is a picture of poor
    quality and has no connection whatever with Holbein.</p>

  <h3 id="PORTRAIT_OF_ANNE_OF_CLEVES">PORTRAIT OF ANNE OF CLEVES</h3>

  <p>Of far greater importance and undisputed authenticity is the <cite>Portrait
    of Anne of Cleves, Fourth Wife of Henry VIII.</cite> (No. 2718). No
    credence is to be attached to the legend invented by Bishop Burnet
    more than a century after that ill-treated lady’s death, according to
    which Holbein’s flattering portrait was instrumental in “bluff King
    Hal’s” choice of his fourth spouse and responsible for the king’s
    disappointment at setting eyes upon Anne. The picture, which was
    painted in 1539, seven years after Holbein’s definite return to England
    and to the service of Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span>, has not only that air of
    inevitable truthfulness which distinguishes all Holbein’s portraiture,
    but tallies to a remarkable degree with the descriptions sent to Henry
    <span class="smcap">viii.</span> by his agents. Whilst not exactly unpleasant to behold,
    the features are those of a spiritless, dull woman—an impression which
    is intensified by the absence of life and character in the hands, which
    Holbein invariably studied as closely as the face. The painting of
    the richly embroidered and jewelled costume, the stately symmetry of
    the design, and the beautiful scheme of colour are really the chief
    attractions of this picture.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Adoration of the Magi</cite> (No. 2711<span class="smcap">a</span>), which was at one time
    attributed to the elder, and subsequently to the younger, Holbein, is
    now rightly given to the latter’s contemporary and compatriot Gumpold
    Giltlinger, an Augsburg painter of no particular distinction.</p>

  <p>Before the end of the sixteenth century German art had entered upon a
    period of complete decadence. The only painter who claims attention,
    not so much for the undeniable merit of his very highly finished
    landscapes, but for the fact that he exercised a certain influence upon
    Rembrandt, is the Frankfort painter, Adam Elsheimer (1578–1621?), who
    worked at Rome, and who is represented at the Louvre by <cite>The Flight
    into Egypt</cite> (No. 2710) and <cite>The Good Samaritan</cite> (No. 2711).</p>

  <p>For the rest, the German painters of his period and of the whole of the
    seventeenth century retained scarcely a trace of national character,
    and were completely under the sway of the foreign, and particularly
    of the Italian, schools. Thus, Johann Rottenhammer (1564–1623), the
    painter of <cite>The Death of Adonis</cite> (No. 2732) and <cite>Diana and Calisto</cite>
    (No. 2733), was successively dominated by Jan Brueghel and by
    Tintoretto. The flower painter, Abraham Mignon (1640–1679), though born
    at Frankfort, was a pupil of David de Heem and a Dutchman in his art.
    His pictures at the Louvre (Nos. 2724–2729) are distributed between
    the German and the Dutch sections. Philipp Peter Roos, better known as
    Rosa da Tivoli (1665?–1705), who painted the <cite>Wolf devouring a Sheep</cite>
    (No. 2731), lived in Rome and adopted the style of the country of his
    domicile. <cite>The Bear Hunt</cite> (No. 2734) is the work of Carl Ruthart,
    another unimportant Italianising German of the second half of the
    seventeenth century.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_EIGHTEENTH_CENTURY">THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

  <p>The work of the Hamburg painter, Baltasar Denner (1685–1749), has no
    claim to be considered as a manifestation of art: it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> merely a
    display of mechanical skill in the microscopic rendering of the little
    lines and pores and stubbly hair on the skin of old people’s faces. He
    lived for seven years in London, where he painted in 1724 the signed
    <cite>Portrait of an Old Woman</cite> (No. 2706), which was bought in 1852 for
    £756. Another characteristic example of his misapplied skill is the
    portrait (No. 2707) in the La Caze Room.</p>

  <p>Christian Wilhelm Dietrich (1712–1774) and Heinrich Wilhelm
    Schweickhardt (1746–1787) are too insignificant to deserve serious
    consideration. The same remark applies to Christian Seybold
    (1703?–1768), who became Court Painter to the Empress Maria Theresa;
    and to Johann Ernest Heinsius, who was active as a portrait painter in
    France during the reign of Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> All that is to be noted
    in their pictures at the Louvre is the total absence of all artistic
    merit.</p>

  <p>Of somewhat greater importance, though by no means of the first rank,
    are the two last German artists who claim our attention: Raphael Mengs
    (1728–1779) and Angelica Kaufmann, (1741–1807), who is catalogued
    among the painters of the German school, although she was Swiss by
    birth, Italian by education, and English by domicile. Her sex was no
    bar to her becoming one of the Foundation members of the English Royal
    Academy, and she is generally counted among the English painters. The
    portrait group of <cite>The Baroness von Krüdner and her Daughter</cite> (No.
    2722) is a poor example of her art, which invariably sought to please
    by conventional prettiness.</p>

  <p>Raphael Mengs, the painter of the portrait of <cite>Marie Amelia Christina
    of Saxony, Wife of Charles III. of Spain</cite>, was born at Aussig in
    Bohemia, studied whilst still a boy in Italy, and became Court Painter
    to Charles <span class="smcap">iii.</span>, who invited him to Madrid in 1761. Mengs was
    an exceedingly accomplished technician and draughtsman, who modelled
    himself on Raphael and the Italian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> eclectics, but was wholly lacking
    in originality and inspiration. He tried his hand in every branch
    of his art, and was most successful in portraiture, although even
    his portraits are lacking in penetration of character. He, however,
    excelled as a copyist, and died in Rome in 1779. </p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THOUGH numerically by no means imposing, the Spanish pictures at the
    Louvre form an exceedingly interesting section of the great French
    national collection, comprising, as they do, characteristic examples of
    the art of practically all the most prominent figures in the evolution
    of Spanish painting. Compared with the schools of Italy and Flanders,
    that of Spain was tardy in its development and very much dependent
    upon foreign influences. The activity of Flemish and Italian masters
    in Spain—we need only mention Starnina, Dello Delli, Rubens, Luca
    Giordano—and the visits of several eminent Spanish masters to Italy,
    could not fail to leave their clear mark on the art of the Peninsula,
    the renaissance of which was almost entirely due to the stimulus
    received from abroad. The short visit of Jan van Eyck to Portugal in
    1429 also had a profound influence on the art of the Peninsula. But
    the local conditions, the strict rule of the Church and the tyranny of
    the Inquisition, the stiff ceremonial of the Court,—the only rival of
    the Church in the patronage of the arts,—and especially the sombre,
    passionate character of the Spanish race,—all helped to transform the
    imported styles into an art of definite national stamp, an art that
    is marked by sombreness, asceticism, dramatic intensity, and deep
    religious feeling. Throughout it is dominated by realistic tendencies
    and rude strength rather than by the striving for grace and beauty and
    rhythm which characterise Italian art.</p>

  <h3 id="LUIS_DE_DALMAU">LUIS DE DALMAU</h3>

  <p>The Louvre is fortunate in possessing an authentic and extremely
    important, though badly restored, altarpiece by Ludovico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> Luis de
    Dalmau, the first Spanish painter whose personality emerges definitely
    from the obscurity of the Gothic period in Spain. Dalmau was a Catalan
    who flourished about the middle of the fifteenth century, and who,
    although not a direct pupil of the Van Eycks, shows such close affinity
    with their style that certain modern critics are inclined to ascribe
    to him, with insufficient reason, certain pictures, like the <cite>Fountain
    of Living Water</cite> at the Prado, by the heads and founders of the Bruges
    school. In spite of the different types and the increased angularity
    of the drapery folds in Dalmau’s <cite>Enthronement of St. Isidore</cite> (No.
    1703<span class="smcap">a</span>), this Eyckian influence is clearly traceable in the
    Louvre picture, which shows the Virgin enthroned under a Gothic canopy
    wearing a crown of typically Spanish form, and handing the pallium to
    the saintly Bishop of Seville, who kneels on the left. Further back on
    the same side are four angels with the episcopal insignia. The group is
    balanced on the right by St. Anthony the Hermit in the foreground, and
    SS. Catherine, Margaret, Agatha, Odilia, and Apollonia grouped around
    the throne. The picture was originally in a church at Valladolid, and
    was bought for the Louvre at the Bourgeois sale at Cologne in 1904 for £3025.</p>

  <h3 id="LUIS_MORALES">LUIS MORALES</h3>

  <p>We need not here pay attention to the few unimportant pictures by
    unknown early Spanish masters in the collection, and may pass on to
    Luis Morales, called “El Divino” (“The Divine”) (1509–1586), who was
    born at Badajoz, and worked at Toledo, when the whole Spanish school
    was already addicted to the Italian mannerisms introduced by Berreguete
    and other native artists trained in Rome. Morales, however, remained
    faithful to the tradition of his own country, and was essentially a
    painter of those religious subjects which enabled him to follow the
    national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> bent for the sombre and tragic—the sufferings of Christ and
    of the Virgin, and similar themes. The <cite>Christ carrying the Cross</cite> (No.
    1707) is a typical instance of the tragic intensity of his conception.
    All the suffering of the Saviour is expressed in His drawn features and
    His heavy, swollen eyelids. The picture is not dated, but was evidently
    painted before 1564, in which year the master was called to the
    Escorial and, while in the service of Philip <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, to a great
    extent lost his individual style in the imitation of the Italians, that
    was probably forced upon him by the taste of his patrons.</p>

  <h3 id="EL_GRECO">EL GRECO</h3>

  <p>We now come to one of the most interesting figures in the history of
    Spanish painting—Dominico Theotocopuli, better known as “El Greco”
    (1548–1614), from the country of his birth. Born in Crete about 1548,
    El Greco entered at a very early age the studio of Titian in Venice.
    This at least we know from a letter written by Clovio from Rome in
    1570, without which, if we were to judge from the master’s early
    style, we should be forced to the conclusion that he acquired his art
    from Tintoretto, and more particularly from Jacopo da Ponte, to whom
    several of his earliest works in private collections were formerly,
    and in some cases are still, ascribed. He went to Rome in 1570, and
    after five or six years took up his abode at Toledo, his first dated
    picture in that city, the scene of his chief activity, bearing the
    date 1577. Between that year and his death in 1614, his extant works
    illustrate the gradual evolution of his art, the change of his Italian
    into a typically Spanish manner, the rapid acquisition of a very
    personal style, and the straining of that personal style to extreme
    mannerism. The notes and flashes of rare, cold, almost acid, but always
    harmonious, colour lend a peculiar distinction to El Greco’s work. His
    predilection for long, narrow faces and slender, emaciated bodies led
    him in his declining years to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> extravagant exaggeration; the ecstatic
    passionate action and gesture of his figures reveal contortion and
    frenzy. As a portrait painter El Greco is second only to Velazquez in
    the school of his adopted country. His biographer, Señor Cossío, has
    called him “a painter of souls,” because he had that intense power of
    penetration which perceives and retains at a glance the sum total of a
    person’s traits of character.</p>

  <p>El Greco’s conception of portraiture enters largely into his pictures
    at the Louvre, from which we must exclude as an imitation by an
    inferior hand the <cite>St. Francis and a Novice</cite> (No. 1729<span class="smcap">a</span>). It
    is certainly an important feature in the large <cite>Christ on the Cross,
    with Two Donors</cite>, one of the comparatively recent acquisitions, which
    still hangs on a screen in Gallery XV. This great altarpiece has little
    of the master’s fierce passion and lightning flashes of colour. The
    expression of the two Donors, Diego and Antonio Covarrubias, who are
    seen to the waist at the foot of the Cross, does not go beyond normal
    pious devotion; and the Saviour seems rather to stand with spread arms
    than to hang on the Cross with all the weight of His characteristically
    elongated body. A leaden grey dominates the whole colour scheme. The
    composition is singularly empty and simple for a master who seemed to
    have a perfect horror of empty spaces. The picture, which is fully
    signed, must have been painted soon after El Greco’s arrival at Toledo
    (and not, as Sñr. Cossío thinks, between 1590 and 1600), since one of
    the Donors, the priest Diego Covarrubias, died in 1577.</p>

  <p>Comparison of the two Donors’ faces with their portraits by the same
    master in the Toledo Library can leave no doubt as to their identity.
    The <cite>Christ on the Cross</cite> was offered by the deputy Isaac Pereire
    of Prades (Pyrenées-Orientales) to the local parish church, but was
    refused and hung in the Palais de Justice at Prades, whence it was
    removed to the Mairie in 1904, and finally sold to the Louvre in 1908
    for £1000. The picture measures 8 ft. 8 in. by 5 ft. 8 in.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

  <p>The <cite>St. Louis of France and a Page</cite> (No. 1729<span class="smcap">b</span>), which was
    formerly wrongly catalogued as <cite>King Ferdinand the Catholic</cite>, is a
    more typical example of El Greco’s management of colour. The boldly
    painted armour is identical with that of the St. Martin on horseback,
    at Toledo. The probable date of the picture, which was bought in 1904
    at the high price of £2800, is between 1594 and 1600.</p>

  <p>By El Greco’s favourite pupil and assistant, Luis Tristan (1586–1640),
    is the realistic half-figure of <cite>St. Francis of Assisi</cite> (No. 1730).
    A more scientific classification of the works by the Toledo painters
    has reversed Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell’s judgment that Tristan had all
    the virtues and none of the faults of his master. He was in reality a
    mediocre imitator of El Greco, without a spark of his master’s genius
    and without any of his distinction.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_SEVILLE">THE SCHOOL OF SEVILLE</h3>

  <p>The naturalistic tendencies inherent in the national Spanish genius,
    which even in the period of Italian mannerism were not to be entirely
    denied, bore full fruit at Seville, where Francisco Herrera “the
    Old” (1576–1656) was the first entirely to reject the tyranny of the
    Italian manner, and with it to a certain extent the tyranny of Church
    patronage. He was a man of fiery character, with whom the technique
    of his art became a veritable passion. It was left to a painter of a
    later century and of another race to proclaim that it does not matter
    <em>what</em> you paint, but <em>how</em> you paint; but Herrera’s work at times
    almost suggests that he was guided by similar principles, although an
    instinctive sense of pictorial fitness saved him from the consequences
    to which their unrestricted application might easily lead.</p>

  <p>In spite of the repelling fierceness, the fanaticism, the cruelty
    of every single face—all of them portraits, no doubt—in the <cite>St.
    Basil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> dictating his Doctrine</cite> (No. 1706) at the Louvre, in spite of
    the essentially Spanish manner in which the design fills the space
    (the figures being grouped in horizontal courses right across the
    canvas, with very little space above for the sky, and this little
    space filled with angels’ heads and with a Holy Ghost as fierce as
    the rest of the assembly), there is a noble rhythm of line as well as
    of the distribution of light and shade, which proclaims the mind of a
    master. The two Saints in the immediate foreground, St. Dominic and
    St. Bernard, are cut through at the waist—another favourite device of
    Spanish composition, which we have already noticed in the Donors of El
    Greco’s <cite>Christ on the Cross</cite>.</p>

  <h3 id="ZURBARAN">ZURBARÁN</h3>

  <p>Considerable though it be, Herrera’s artistic achievement does not
    constitute his chief claim to fame; for his name will ever be best
    known as that of the first master of the greatest of all Spanish
    painters, Don Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez. But before
    discussing the pictures by, or catalogued under the name of, Velazquez
    at the Louvre, we must consider the work of two other painters of
    the Naturalistic school: Francisco de Zurbarán (1598–1661) and José
    de Ribera, called “Lo Spagnoletto” (1588–1656). Zurbarán, a pupil of
    the Sevillan Juan de las Roelas, was essentially a painter of church
    pictures, his favourite subjects being types of monks and scenes of
    monkish life. There is something so sincere and convincing in his
    unrelenting realism, that even his pictures of rapturous ecstasy and
    strongly emphasised emotion impress one as truthful renderings of types
    observed by the artist in the streets and churches of monastic Seville.
    The sombre passion with which his subjects are instinct is reflected
    by his colour and masterly chiaroscuro. Zurbarán became Court Painter
    to Philip <span class="smcap">iv.</span> in or before 1633, in which year he added the
    words “<cite>Pintor del Rey</cite>” to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> his signature on one of his pictures; and
    in this capacity he painted at Madrid his only known secular pictures,
    a series of ten Scenes from the History of Hercules.</p>

  <p>Two admirable pictures from his brush figure in the Louvre Catalogue as
    <cite>St. Peter Nolasque and St. Raymond de Peñafort</cite> (No. 1738) and <cite>The
    Funeral of a Bishop</cite> (No. 1739). As a matter of fact they represent
    two scenes from the life of St. Bonaventura: <cite>The Saint presiding at a
    Chapter of Minor Brothers</cite>, and <cite>The Funeral of St Bonaventura</cite>. The
    second of these companion pictures which were originally in a convent
    at Seville is particularly striking for the unconventionality of its
    composition, the strong character of the heads, and the masterly
    treatment of the chiaroscuro. Note again the placing of the heads
    almost in a horizontal line right across the canvas, and the anxious
    avoidance of empty spaces. The third picture that stands to Zurbarán’s
    name is the figure of <cite>A Lady of Fashion in the Character of St.
    Apollonia</cite> (No. 1740), a work of not very striking merit.</p>

  <h3 id="RIBERA">RIBERA</h3>

  <p>Ribera, though born near Valencia, where he received his early
    education in the painter’s art in the studio of Ribalta, was still
    young in years when he left his native land for Italy, never to
    return. Studying and working at Rome, Parma, and Naples, he was so
    strongly influenced by Caravaggio, and to a minor extent by Correggio,
    that, taking also into account his long domicile, there is some
    justification for those who treat him as belonging to the Italian
    school of Naturalists. The most prominent feature of his art is the
    violent and abrupt contrasting of brilliant lights with very deep and
    heavy shadows, which enforces the almost cruel dramatic intensity of
    his scenes of torture, convulsions, and suffering. In this use of
    chiaroscuro he was a true follower of Caravaggio, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> Ribera, even
    where he is most Italian, never denies his Spanish nationality and the
    teaching of his first master.</p>

  <p>Nowhere are his racial characteristics more pronounced than in
    the admirable character-study, in the La Caze Room, of a grinning
    beggar-boy who suffers from an infirmity from which the picture derives
    its popular name, <cite>The Club-foot</cite> (No. 1725). The boy is standing
    in bold silhouette against a clouded sky. He shoulders his crutch
    like a gun, and carries in his left hand a sheet of paper with the
    inscription—<span class="smcap">da mihi elemosinam propter amorem dei</span>.</p>

  <p>If <cite>The Club-foot</cite> is scarcely typical of the qualities that are
    generally associated with Ribera’s art, the Louvre owns two thoroughly
    characteristic examples of his more violent manner, of his dramatic
    use of sharply contrasted light and shade, in <cite>The Entombment</cite> (No.
    1722) and <cite>St. Paul the Hermit</cite> (No. 1723), which bears on a stone the
    signature</p>

  <div class="center small">JUSEPE DE RIBERA ESPAGNOL P.F.</div>

  <p class="noindent">In <cite>The Entombment</cite> the master-hand is revealed by the
    superb breadth with which the limp yet weighty body of the Saviour
    is painted. It is not modelled in all its plastic roundness, but cut
    into sharp flat passages of light and shadow, the plastic relief
    being suggested by the perfection of the anatomical drawing and
    foreshortening. Poignant grief is expressed in the faces of St. Joseph
    of Arimathæa, the Virgin Mary, St. John, and Nicodemus, who surround
    the body, the head of which is supported by St. Joseph. The same
    subject is treated with less masterly authority in <cite>The Entombment</cite>
    (No. 1725<span class="smcap">a</span>), which can only be accepted as a school picture.</p>

  <p>The ascetic fervour tinged with a sense almost of cruel pleasure
    in self-inflicted suffering, with which Ribera loved to invest his
    semi-nude figures of emaciated saints, hermits, and martyrs, will be
    found in the <cite>St. Paul the Hermit</cite>. The picture was bought in 1875 for
    £252.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>Without loss of realistic power, and without affectation or conscious
    striving for prettiness, Ribera shows more human tenderness and gentle
    emotion in <cite>The Adoration of the Shepherds</cite> (No. 1721), a picture
    signed and dated on a stone in the right-hand corner,</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Juse Ribera español Academico romano, F. 1650.</i></div>

  <p class="noindent">In accordance with the nature of the subject he has here
    refrained from making use of abrupt light and shade, the whole scene
    being enveloped in a warm glow. The types are not idealised, but
    are apparently faithful portraits of their respective models. Very
    similar to the central group in this canvas, but more sonorous in its
    depth of colour, from which gleam forth the strong lights, is the
    <cite>Virgin and Child</cite> (No. 1724) in the La Caze Room. The four pictures
    of <cite>Philosophers</cite> (Nos. 1726–1729), likewise in the La Caze Bequest,
    which the official Catalogue gives to Ribera, are certainly not by that
    master. It has been suggested that they may be the work of Ribera’s
    facile and versatile pupil, Luca Giordano (“Fa Presto”), but the poor
    quality of these paintings scarcely justifies even this attribution.
    They were formerly in the collection of General Mazzavedo.</p>

  <p>Ribera had a romantic career, rising as he did from absolute penury to
    almost despotic power as a member of a triumvirate that would brook no
    competition in Naples and would shrink from no means to further their
    schemes. Nothing is known as to how he died. He disappeared in 1656,
    and probably found his death in the depths of the sea.</p>

  <h3 id="VELAZQUEZ">VELAZQUEZ</h3>

  <p>The Catalogue of the Louvre collection contains an imposing list of
    seven works by the king of Spanish painters. Critical examination of
    these pictures will, however, result in the elimination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> of all but
    two that figure in the list. Velazquez, who was destined to stamp his
    great personality on a whole generation of Spanish painters, but whose
    art was little known in Northern Europe previous to the Peninsular
    War, has exercised a paramount influence on modern art. He was born of
    noble descent at Seville in June 1599. Although originally destined for
    another profession, he showed such talent for art that he was allowed
    to enter the studio of Francisco Herrera, of whose realistic tendencies
    and rugged strength we have already had occasion to speak.</p>

  <p>From his studio he passed into that of the cultured and erudite
    Francisco Pacheco, whose artistic achievement at its best was far in
    advance of his professed academic principles. Summoned to Madrid in
    1623 by the powerful Count Duke of Olivarez, Velazquez entered the
    service of King Philip <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Velazquez became his favourite
    Court Painter, received other important offices and emoluments, and
    after his return from his second visit to Italy in 1651—the first visit
    had taken place in 1629—he was appointed <cite>Aposentador del Rey</cite>, a post
    which approximately corresponds with that of Court-Marshal. He died on
    the 6th of August 1660, from the results of fatigue and overwork in
    supervising the arrangements for the betrothal of the Infanta Maria
    Teresa to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> at the Palace on the Isle of Pheasants,
    at Irun.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the early <i>bodegones</i> of his student-years and
    a few rare excursions into the realm of religious and mythological
    composition, Velazquez’s life-work, as conditioned by the patronage of
    the king and the Court, was practically confined to portraiture. His
    unrivalled greatness in this sphere is due to the perfect clearness
    of his vision, which made him grasp the person or scene before his
    eyes at a single glance, and transpose his impression to canvas with
    undisturbed directness and completeness, and with an apparent disregard
    of the means of expression. There is dignity and soberness in all his
    portraits; perfect spacing; noble, firm <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>contour; complete unity of
    all the parts produced by the sense of ambient atmosphere. And never is
    there the slightest hint of trick of hand, or mannerism, or painting by
    recipe. Each picture is the result of close observation, recorded with
    admirable directness and honesty. This supreme master of the painter’s
    technique seemed to pay no attention to technique—or, at least, the
    result is invariably so significant and so absorbingly interesting
    that the spectator, unless he approaches the picture with deliberate
    intention to probe its secret, never thinks of the technical means by

  <h3 id="THE_INFANTA">THE INFANTA</h3>

  <p>In the Louvre collection there is but one picture from which it is
    possible to judge the greatness of Velazquez’s art. That picture is
    the deservedly famous and often-copied portrait of the little <cite>Infanta
    Margarita</cite> (No. 1731, <a href="#i_plate25">Plate XXV.</a>), which has rightly been placed in the
    Salon Carré among the proudest possessions which the Gallery can boast.
    The little princess, who was born in 1651, the first child of Mariana
    of Austria, is here depicted at the age of about four, so that the
    date of the portrait may safely be assumed to be about the year 1655,
    and not 1659, as suggested by M. Lafenestre. She is dressed in a white
    robe with black lace trimmings. A pink ribbon is tied on her right side
    to her soft light golden hair, which falls in curls to her shoulders;
    her right hand rests upon a chair, whilst the left, the fingers of
    which have been repainted owing to the addition of a narrow strip of
    canvas at the bottom, holds a flower. On the top the words <span class="smcap">linfante
    margverite</span> are painted in heavy block letters across the whole
    width of the canvas. This picture, in which childlike ingenuousness
    is so happily blended with quaint dignity, and in which even the
    forbidding ugliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> of the dress of the period cannot destroy the
    little princess’s grace and doll-like charm, Velazquez has surely left
    to the world one of the most entrancing portraits of lovable childhood
    that is to be found in the whole history of art.</p>

  <h3 id="MARIANA_OF_AUSTRIA">MARIANA OF AUSTRIA</h3>

  <p>The other unquestionably authentic work by the master at the Louvre is
    to be found in the La Caze Bequest. It is catalogued as <cite>Portrait of
    the Infanta Maria Teresa, afterwards Queen of France</cite> (No. 1735), but
    is in reality a portrait of <cite>Queen Mariana of Austria</cite>, the mother of
    the Infanta Margarita Maria. Mariana was married to Philip <span class="smcap">iv.</span>
    as his second wife in 1649, at the age of fourteen. Velazquez was at
    that time in Italy, so that the duty of painting her first portrait for
    the royal bridegroom fell to the Court Painter’s son-in-law and chief
    pupil, Juan Bautista del Mazo (1610–1667).</p>

  <p>The portrait at the Louvre was, if we may judge from the apparent age
    of the child-queen as she is here represented, painted in 1651, when
    Velazquez had returned from his second Italian journey and when Mariana
    was sixteen years of age. It was probably a preliminary study from life
    for the larger portrait in the Vienna Gallery. This admirable portrait
    is another artistic triumph over unfavourable conditions imposed by
    the hideousness of contemporary female attire, although the forehead
    has been spoilt by clumsy repainting. The coiffure in particular, a
    cascade of false hair, bows, jewels, and feathers, is more suggestive
    of some exotic idol or fetish than of a human being. In 1863, before
    the judgment of a tasteless age, which gave Velazquez a position far
    below the then absurdly overrated Murillo, was revised, this portrait
    of Mariana appeared at the Viardot sale and failed to realise more than
    £200!</p>

    <h3 id="COPIES_AND_SCHOOL_PICTURES">COPIES AND SCHOOL PICTURES</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Two other portraits in the La Caze Room are attributed to Velazquez.
    One of these, a <cite>Portrait of Philip IV.</cite> (No. 1733) at the age of about
    fifty, is unquestionably a wholly uninspired and fairly modern copy of
    the head in the Prado (No. 1080). The other, a <cite>Portrait of a Young
    Woman</cite> (No. 1736), is an extremely feeble imitation of the superficial
    aspect of Velazquez’s manner—so bad in drawing, especially in the
    attachment of the nose to the face, that it is difficult to accept
    Señor Beruete’s attribution of this picture to Juan Carreño de Miranda
    (1614–1685), an able painter of the Madrid school. M. Henri Rodolphe
    Elissa, who exposed the “Tiara of Saitaphernes” forgery, has asserted
    that he can prove both the <cite>Philip IV.</cite> and the <cite>Young Woman</cite> to be
    the work of the Spanish painter Escosura, who died in the last decade
    of the nineteenth century. There appears to be no reason to doubt his
    assertion. The head of Philip, more than the other picture, appears to
    be nineteenth-century work.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Portrait of Philip IV., King of Spain, in Hunting Costume</cite> (No.
    1732), with a gun in his right hand and a dog sitting by his side, in
    a landscape background, is only a contemporary copy of a very similar
    picture in the Prado, to which it is vastly inferior in execution. It
    is true that in the Prado picture the king’s hat is on his head, whilst
    in the Louvre version, which is probably by Mazo, he carries it in his
    left hand. It is, however, possible to detect in the Prado portrait
    clear evidence of a pentimento, from which it can be seen that here,
    too, the hat was originally in the same position as in the Louvre
    canvas. Presumably Velazquez subsequently made the alteration; but the
    copy was executed at an earlier date.</p>

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
    <h3 id="THE_MEETING_OF_THIRTEEN_PEOPLE">THE “MEETING OF THIRTEEN PEOPLE”</h3>
  </div>

  <p>There have been great divergences of opinion concerning the strange
    little painting representing a <cite>Meeting of Thirteen People</cite> (No. 1734)
    on a hill. It was formerly known as <cite>A Meeting of Artists</cite>, because
    two of the Spanish cavaliers depicted in the group were believed to
    represent Velazquez and Murillo. Lauded at first as one of Velazquez’s
    masterpieces by those who were carried away by the truly extraordinary
    beauty of the pearly, opalescent colour harmony and the atmospheric
    quality of the painting, the little picture has lately been as
    violently abused for its “poor design, weak execution, and commonplace
    arrangement.” As a matter of fact the arrangement is anything but
    commonplace, and the picture has great qualities of technique which
    will always be the delight of professional artists. It is moreover
    admirably varied in gesture and action, even if it has certain
    weaknesses which render impossible its unqualified attribution to
    Velazquez. Here we have clearly an excellent example of his son-in-law
    and imitator, J. B. del Mazo. If any proof were needed for this
    attribution, it will be found in the figure on the extreme left of the
    composition. Both his legs are slanting forward so much that his centre
    of gravity plumbs behind his heels. It would really be impossible to
    maintain this posture, which, though it offends against the laws of
    gravity, is to be found in quite a number of Mazo’s pictures, as, for
    instance, in the small figure of Olivarez (?) in the middle distance
    on the right in the Duke of Westminster’s <cite>Don Baltazar Carlos in the
    Riding School</cite>, in the portrait of <cite>Don Baltazar Carlos</cite> at The Hague,
    and in the second boy in <cite>The Family of Mazo</cite> at the Vienna Gallery.</p>

  <p>The soundly painted <cite>Portrait of Don Pedro de Altamira, Doyen of the
    Chapel Royal at Toledo, afterwards Cardinal</cite> (No. 1737), inscribed on
    the background “<span class="smcap">æt 54 dv, 1633</span>,” is a good character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>-study of
    an energetic and rather worldly-looking Church dignitary, but does not
    appear to be either by Velazquez or one of his immediate followers.</p>

  <p>There is in the Spanish section of the Louvre another superbly painted,
    but very problematic, <cite>Head of a Man</cite> (No. 1747), which, on no more
    plausible grounds than an accidental likeness to one of the figures
    in <cite>The Forge of Vulcan</cite>, has by some critics been believed to be by
    Velazquez. The rich impasto and the careful finish of the painting are
    utterly unlike Velazquez’s manner; nor does the picture appear to be
    of his period. But whoever may be its author, it is one of the most
    remarkable paintings in this section of the Louvre.</p>

  <h3 id="MURILLO">MURILLO</h3>

  <p>By far the best represented of all the masters at the Spanish school is
    Bartolomé Estéban Murillo (1618?–1682). He was born at Seville, of poor
    parents, and studied as a boy under Juan del Castillo. Forced before he
    had reached manhood to gain his livelihood, he took to manufacturing
    artistically worthless devotional pictures on saga-cloth, for sale at
    the weekly fairs in the poor quarter of Seville. This early practice
    of rather mechanical production, and the habit, acquired by necessity,
    of working to please the public, clung to him in after life and are
    responsible for much that the modern mind finds distasteful in his
    art—a certain sickly sentimentality that often takes the place of real
    sentiment, and an artificiality of arrangement even where the types are
    realistic renderings of the people among whom he spent his days.</p>

  <p>With his small savings from the proceeds of his crude popular pictures
    Murillo proceeded to Madrid, where Velazquez assisted him by deed,
    advice, and example, though the two artists were probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> never in the
    relation of master and pupil. After about two years thus profitably
    spent at Madrid, Murillo returned to Seville, where he continued to
    work until his death in 1682, and rose to the very summit of fame and
    popularity. At his best Murillo was a colourist of great charm and a
    technician of the rarest skill. His art is most admirable where he
    adheres most closely to the realistic tradition of his country. It
    is scarcely to be credited that the same hand which produced so many
    vaporous and vapid Madonnas is responsible for a picture painted with
    such superb breadth and incisive vigour as <cite>The Young Beggar</cite> (No.
    1717), which is almost worthy of the brush of Velazquez in his Sevillan
    period. The decidedly unsavoury subject is made acceptable by the
    consummate artistry of the treatment.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_IMMACULATE_CONCEPTION">“THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION”</h3>

  <p>It is not, however, to pictures of this type that Murillo owed his
    widespread popularity. Generations of enthusiastic admirers have
    stood in silent awe before his large painting of <cite>The Immaculate
    Conception</cite> (No. 1709, <a href="#i_plate26">Plate XXVI.</a>), which is certainly one of the best
    of innumerable versions of the same subject—the Virgin standing on a
    crescent moon, with ecstatic gaze, and hands pressed to her breast,
    and surrounded by swarms of joyous angel-children—painted by Murillo
    to meet an apparently insatiable demand. There is something of real
    ecstasy in this conception. To find a similar <i>morbidezza</i> of pigment
    one must turn to certain famous works by Andrea del Sarto: it is a
    quality which is generally conspicuously absent from Spanish painting
    and which, if carried a step farther, as it sometimes was carried by
    Murillo, would result in fuzzy vapidness. This famous picture has the
    distinction of being the most costly purchase ever made for the Louvre,
    the price paid for it at the Marshal Soult sale <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>in 1852—that is
    many years before American competition had established the vastly
    enhanced standards of value which now prevail—being as much as 615,300
    fr., or £24,612.</p>

  <p>Apparently of earlier date is the other version of the same subject at
    the Louvre. This <cite>Immaculate Conception</cite> (No. 1708) is not painted in
    the same spirit of exaltation as the version just described, but has
    a happy passage of realistic character-painting in the six kneeling
    figures on the left. On the right two angels carry a scroll with the
    inscription <span class="smcap">in principio dilexit eam</span>. The picture was painted
    in 1656–57 for the Church of Santa Maria la Blanca at Seville, and
    was carried off to France, with many other of the master’s works, by
    Marshal Soult.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_BIRTH_OF_THE_VIRGIN">THE “BIRTH OF THE VIRGIN”</h3>

  <p>Another picture that formed part of the loot taken by Napoleon’s
    general and was taken in 1855 from his son, the Duke of Dalmatia, in
    liquidation of a debt of £6000, is <cite>The Birth of the Virgin</cite> (No.
    1710). The National Gallery in London owns a small preliminary study
    for this painting, which was executed in 1655 for Seville Cathedral.
    The centre is occupied by a beautifully disposed group of four women
    and four winged heavenly visitors attending to the Infant’s bath; in
    the background on the left St. Anne, raised in her bed, is receiving
    visitors, and on the right are seen two attendants airing linen at
    a fireplace. The strange assemblage, in which the earthly and the
    heavenly are without incongruity brought into such close contact that
    one of the boy-angels is actually occupied with a dog, is completed
    by another four angels floating in the air above the Infant. In
    composition, distribution of light and shade, and in harmonious
    blending of mellow colour this picture ranks among Murillo’s highest
    achievements. According to Cean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> Bermudez, the roundness, beauty of
    shape, and rosy complexion of the waiting-woman’s arm in the foreground
    “excited the jealous envy of the ladies of Seville.” It is interesting
    to note that before its acquisition by the Louvre the <cite>Birth of the
    Virgin</cite> was brought to England in 1823, when the owners vainly tried to
    find a purchaser.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_ANGELS_KITCHEN">“THE ANGELS’ KITCHEN”</h3>

  <p>Yet another deservedly famous work by Murillo, removed from a
    Franciscan convent at Seville by the insatiable greed of Marshal Soult,
    is the now extensively restored large picture known as <cite>The Miracle of
    San Diego</cite>, or <cite>The Angels’ Kitchen</cite> (No. 1716). The composition is
    divided by two large figures of angels into two halves. On the left two
    knights of Calatrava are shown in by a Franciscan brother and behold
    St. Diego in prayer miraculously raised into the air and surrounded
    by a flood of light. On the right the angels are occupied with the
    preparation of the repast for which the Saint has sent his prayer to
    the Virgin. A Franciscan is watching the scene from the distance with
    a gesture of amazement. Here again the real and the supernatural are
    blended with unaffected naïveté, the unity of the contending elements
    being established by the masterly rendering of light and atmosphere.
    An account of the miracle is given on a cartouche in the foreground;
    whilst a piece of paper on the left holds the signature</p>

  <div class="center small">BART-EST. MURILLO, 1646.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><cite>The Angels’ Kitchen</cite> was bought from the despoiler’s heirs
    for £3420.</p>

  <p><cite>The Virgin of the Rosary</cite> (No. 1712), unlike the majority of Murillo’s
    representations of the Mother of God, has scarcely a trace of spiritual
    exaltation, but is merely a handsome type of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> happy and contented
    Spanish mother. The folds of her outer garment are arranged in florid
    and meaningless profusion.</p>

  <p><cite>The Holy Family</cite> (No. 1713), also known as <cite>The Virgin of Seville</cite>, is
    a genuine and characteristic, though strangely overrated work by the
    master, and bears the signature</p>

  <div class="center small">BARTOLOM DE MURILLO F. HISPAN.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><cite>The Virgin in Glory</cite> (No. 1711) is, to say the least,
    of doubtful authenticity. The small companion pictures, <cite>Christ in
    the Garden of Olives</cite> (No. 1714) and <cite>Christ at the Column and St.
    Peter</cite> (No. 1715), are painted on marble, to which fact they owe the
    unpleasant coldness of their colouring.</p>

  <p>In the La Caze Room are two portraits, <cite>The Poet Quevedo</cite> (No. 1718)
    and <cite>The Duke of Ossuña</cite> (No. 1719), which the official Catalogue
    ascribes to Murillo. Quite apart from the fact that the artist was
    only six years of age when the Duke of Ossuña died, the quality of the
    painting does not justify these attributions. Like the head of Philip
    <span class="smcap">iv.</span> in the same room, they were probably painted by Escosura,
    a late-nineteenth-century Spaniard</p>

  <h3 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_MADRID">THE SCHOOL OF MADRID</h3>

  <p>We must now return to Madrid, where the example of Velazquez had
    inspired a fairly numerous group of able painters without particular
    genius, whose art, being entirely derivative, carried within itself
    the germ of decay and sank to complete insignificance before the close
    of the century. The most distinguished artist of this group is Juan
    Bautista del Mazo, who has already been referred to as the author
    of the <cite>Meeting of Thirteen People</cite> and probably of the <cite>Philip IV.
    in Hunting Costume</cite>. So well did he succeed in appropriating his
    father-in-law’s style that his best works have frequently passed under
    his illustrious master’s name.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

  <p>Another important painter of the Madrid school is Carreño de Miranda
    (Nos. 1614–1685), who benefited by Velazquez’s patronage, became
    painter of the Palace in 1669, and Court Painter and Assistant
    Seneschal in 1671. Although in his later years he devoted himself
    largely to subject pictures which are distinguished by a warmer
    colouring than most of the productions by the Madrid school of the
    period, he achieved his greatest successes as a portrait painter. He
    was considerably influenced by the paintings of Van Dyck, which he
    had occasion to study in the royal palaces. His large <cite>St. Ambrose
    distributing Alms</cite> (No. 1702), in the La Caze Gallery, is a hurriedly
    executed work which does not show his art to the best advantage. It
    figured in the sale of the Soult collection, when it failed to realise
    £20.</p>

  <p>Far more typical of its author’s best manner is <cite>The Burning Bush</cite> (No.
    1703) by Francisco Collantes (1599–1656), a Madrid painter who studied
    under Vincente Carducho, but was influenced by Bassano. He was an
    excellent colourist, especially in his landscape paintings with small
    figures. His most famous picture is <cite>The Vision of Ezekiel</cite>, formerly
    at the Buen Retiro Palace and now in the Prado Gallery.</p>

  <p>Juan de Arellano (1614–1676), the painter of the <cite>Flowers</cite> (No. 1701),
    worked at Madrid, unknown and in abject poverty, until at the age of
    thirty-six he began to devote himself to flower-painting, a branch
    of art in which he developed considerable skill, and rose to great
    popularity.</p>

  <p>Yet another Madrid painter who is but indifferently represented at the
    Louvre by a still life of <cite>Fruit and Musical Instruments</cite> (No. 1720)
    in the La Caze collection, is Antonio Pereda (1599–1669). Although a
    contemporary of Velazquez and working in the same city, he was not
    appreciably influenced by that master. He was a pupil of Pedro de las
    Cuevas, and his style shows certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> affinities with Ribera. His works
    are rarely to be met with outside the galleries and churches of his own
    country.</p>

  <p>The end of the seventeenth century marked the complete decadence of the
    Spanish school, which was precipitated and received its final seal by
    the advent in 1692 of the Neapolitan Luca Giordano, whose rare facility
    in the production of showy, flashy, meretricious works earned for him
    the sobriquet “Fa Presto,” and whose prodigious success was a powerful
    incentive to emulation. More fatal even than the influence of Luca
    Giordano was that of the German artist Raphael Mengs, an uninspired
    eclectic who became Court Painter to Charles <span class="smcap">iii.</span>, and who
    is referred to in the chapter dealing with the German pictures at the
    Louvre.</p>

  <h3 id="GOYA">GOYA</h3>

  <p>In this time of complete stagnation the fascinating personality of
    Francisco Goya y Lucientes (1746–1828) flashes like a bright meteor
    through the dark night of Spanish art. Goya takes a unique position
    in the art of his country—or, indeed, of the world. He was as much
    the last of the old masters as he is the first of the moderns. A man
    of fiery temperament, impulsive, unruly, opposed to authority, he was
    terribly unequal in his performance. It is as unnecessary to state
    who were his masters as it is impossible to speak of his style in
    general terms, for there probably never was an artist who worked in
    so many different styles, experimented in so many different mediums,
    and treated so vast a range of subjects as Goya. He was a creature of
    moods, and changed his method of painting as easily as his political
    allegiance from Bourbon to Bonaparte and back again to Bourbon.</p>

  <p>His four pictures at the Louvre are without exception portraits, and do
    not therefore illustrate his highly developed sense of the dramatic.
    But they serve admirably to show his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> active protest against the
    classicist affectation prevalent at his time, and his return to the
    healthy realism which is the heritage of his race. The <cite>Portrait of F.
    Guillemardet, Ambassador of the French Republic to Spain</cite> (No. 1704),
    is an admirably honest piece of portraiture, dignified but perfectly
    natural in pose, strong in expression and pleasing in colour. It was
    bequeathed to the Louvre by Guillemardet, together with the <cite>Young
    Spanish Woman</cite> (No. 1705) in a black mantilla, standing with crossed
    arms against a pearly-grey landscape background. The seated half-figure
    of the rather corpulent <cite>Young Spanish Woman</cite> (No. 1705<span class="smcap">a</span>) was
    bought at the Kums sale at Antwerp for £1276; and the portrait of <cite>Don
    Perez de Castro</cite> (No. 1705<span class="smcap">b</span>) was acquired in 1902 for £1200.
    Goya was an isolated figure in Spanish art of the time. He left no
    “school,” but his influence was one of the leading factors in the rise
    of the modern movement in France.</p>

    <h2 id="THE_DUTCH_SCHOOL">THE DUTCH SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WE have already followed the development of the early Flemish or
    Netherlandish art during the fifteenth century, and observed how
    it eventually passed under the Italianising influences which are
    unmistakable in the pictures of Barend van Orley (1495?–1542) and
    his contemporaries. The early painters of Holland as distinct from
    Flanders cannot be traced with any certainty much farther back than
    Albert von Ouwater (fl. 1420–1460), who worked at Haarlem from 1430 to
    1460. As we have already seen, the early Flemish painter, Gerard David
    (1460?–1523), was born at Ouwater, which may well have had its school
    of painters. Neither Albert von Ouwater, who is represented to-day by
    a single work, the <cite>Raising of Lazarus</cite> in the Berlin Gallery, nor his
    unidentifiable contemporary who painted the <cite>Exhumation of St. Hubert</cite>,
    in the National Gallery (No. 783), are included in the collection of
    pictures at the Louvre.</p>

  <h3 id="GERARD_OF_HAARLEM">GERARD OF HAARLEM</h3>

  <p>The influence of these painters and Dierick Bouts is seen in the rare
    works of Geertgen tot S. Jans, or Gerard of Haarlem (1465–1493) whose
    <cite>Raising of Lazarus</cite> (No. 2563<span class="smcap">a</span>) in this collection is an
    achievement of the highest order, and was purchased as recently as
    1902 for £4000 from Baron d’Albenas, after having been for many years
    in Spain. This pupil or follower of the Ouwater master was a native of
    Leyden, and worked at Haarlem. He took his name from the commandery of
    the Knights of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> John at Haarlem for whom he worked, as we see from
    the careful inscription, “<i>Gerardus Leydanus pictor ad S. Io. Baptist.
    Harlem pinxt</i>,” on his triptych at Vienna.</p>

  <p>Among his contemporaries were Cornelis Engelbrechtsen, who was born
    in 1468 at Leyden, where he died in 1533, and Lucas van Leyden
    (1494–1533). The latter played an important part as an engraver quite
    as much as a painter in the university town of Leyden, which now
    possesses his large <cite>Last Judgment</cite> and became famous as the birthplace
    of Rembrandt in 1606. The Louvre possesses no picture by either
    Engelbrechtsen or Lucas van Leyden.</p>

  <p>Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen (fl. 1470–1533) is also unrepresented
    here. Portraits by painters in this group are often confused, as in the
    case of the <cite>Portrait of the Duke of East Friesland</cite>, in the Oldenburg
    Gallery, which has been attributed to both Lucas van Leyden and Jacob
    Cornelisz. A pupil of the latter may have painted the <cite>Cana of Galilee</cite>
    (No. 2640<span class="smcap">c</span>). It is safe to assign to “the Master of the
    Female Half Figures,” the <cite>Young Lady Reading</cite> (No. 2641<span class="smcap">c</span>),
    which has a close analogy with the well-known picture in the Harrach
    collection at Vienna, representing half-length figures of three young
    ladies in crimson velvet dresses cut square at the neck, and singing
    to the accompaniment of a flute and a lute. The name of this painter
    is not known, but his pictures, which are neither numerous nor of any
    conspicuous merit, are easily recognisable.</p>

  <p>To this period of transition and mediocre painting belongs Jan
    Scorel (1495–1562), whose <cite>Portrait of Paracelsus the Doctor</cite> (No.
    2567<span class="smcap">a</span>) is inscribed:</p>

  <div class="center small">“FORMOSO DOCTOR PARASELSUS,”</div>

  <p class="noindent">and is in every way superior to the <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No.
    2641<span class="smcap">b</span>), which is labelled with the name of Scorel, but
    catalogued as being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> by an unknown artist. From Scorel, a much
    travelled Dutch artist, who at one time worked at Nuremburg with
    Albrecht Dürer and visited Venice and the East, we naturally pass
    to Jan Mostaert of Haarlem. Mostaert of Haarlem is unrepresented at
    the Louvre, a remark which equally well applies to the anonymous
    “Pseudo-Mostaert,” who painted so much in his style that a large
    number of inferior productions have been credited to him from time
    to time. Pictures of this type vary so considerably that the name
    “Pseudo-Mostaert” is little more than a generic designation for
    unassignable Flemish and Dutch pictures of the middle of the sixteenth
    century; such pictures bear some relationship to the <cite>Christ bearing
    His Cross</cite> (No. 2299), and the <cite>Abraham’s Sacrifice</cite> (No. 2300),
    officially attributed to the little-known and quite negligible painter
    Alart Claeszoon (1498–1564) of Leyden.</p>

  <h3 id="SIR_ANTONIS_MOR">SIR ANTONIS MOR</h3>

  <p>From Leyden we may pass to Utrecht, which was the birthplace of the
    much-travelled, distinguished, and cosmopolitan painter, Antonis Mor
    (1512–1578?). He was a pupil of Jan Scorel, but soon freed himself
    from the hard manner he acquired under that master by his study in
    Italy of the best works of the Venetians. Indeed, some of his pictures
    have passed as the work of Calcar, the pupil of Titian. Mor, or Moro,
    excelled as a painter of vigorous and truthful portraits, and the
    portraits and replicas he painted of Queen Mary are well known. The
    Prado Gallery at Madrid and the Vienna Gallery contain good examples
    of his art, and he is fairly well represented in the Louvre. While he
    was in the service of Philip II. of Spain he lived in much splendour,
    and was amply paid for his work. His close intimacy with the monarch
    induced him on one occasion to take the liberty of touching with a
    brush dipped in red paint the hand of the king. This serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> breach
    of Court etiquette created a profound impression on the courtiers
    present; and, although the painter sued for pardon and obtained it from
    the king, he soon recognised that he had made himself obnoxious to the
    Inquisition, who asserted that Moro had got from the heretic English,
    while painting the portrait of Queen Mary, a charm that enabled him to
    bewitch the Spanish monarch. Being thus compelled to leave Spain, he
    settled in Antwerp, where he died between 1576 and 1578.</p>

  <p>The pictures of Mor, who was the contemporary of Titian, at different
    periods of his art bear traces of the Dutch, Spanish, and Flemish
    schools. He in turn also had an influence on the portrait painters of
    Spain half a century before the birth of Velazquez. The <cite>Portrait of a
    Man</cite> (No. 2478), which is signed and dated:</p>

  <div class="center small">“<i>ANT MORO pingebat, 1565</i>,”</div>

  <p class="noindent">was in the past held by some writers to bear the features of Sir
    Francis Drake, who was, however, at the date here given only twenty-one
    years of age. The two large paintings in the Duchâtel Bequest which
    pass as the <cite>Portrait of Louis de Rio</cite> and <cite>His Wife</cite> (No. 2480 and No.
    2481) are, judging by the attitudes of the figures and the shape of the
    panels, the wings of a large altarpiece. <cite>The Dwarf of Charles V.</cite> (No.
    2479) reminds us that the painter, while still young, was taken into
    the service of that emperor. <cite>The Portrait of Edward VI. of England</cite>
    (No. 2481<span class="smcap">a</span>) bears a very suspicious-looking inscription.</p>

  <h3 id="SPANISH_OPPRESSION">SPANISH OPPRESSION</h3>

  <p>The political events of the reign of Philip II. of Spain, the mistaken,
    mischievous, and oppressive policy he adopted with regard to his
    territory in the Netherlands, and the contempt with which he treated
    his Dutch subjects, soon alienated their sympathies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> but the Duke of
    Alva by his harshness and bigotry incited them to frenzy. When he set
    forth in 1567, all hope of peace and mercy fled before him, and within
    a short period his tyranny and ferocity fanned the flame of rebellion,
    which after a struggle of eighty years was to end in the Peace of
    Münster of 1648. In that year Spain ignominiously surrendered, and
    the independence of the northern Netherlands was recognised. During
    the long period which elapsed between the Union of Utrecht in 1579
    and the negotiations at Osnabrück and Münster in 1648 must have been
    destroyed innumerable religious pictures, the loss of which renders it
    almost impossible for us to estimate the full significance of artistic
    endeavour in Holland in the closing years of the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>A new era in Dutch history, social life and art was beginning to
    open out by the year 1612, when Abraham Blomaert (1564–1651) painted
    and signed his very large <cite>Nativity</cite> (No. 2327), which was formerly
    attributed to Bernardino Fassolo. Blomaert’s <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No.
    2327<span class="smcap">a</span>) is also a signed work.</p>

  <h3 id="HISTORY_AND_PORTRAIT_PAINTERS">HISTORY AND PORTRAIT PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>Blomaert’s contemporary, Michiel Jansz Mierevelt (1567–1641), who
    was at one time Court painter to the Princes of Orange at The Hague,
    and was with undue flattery hailed as the “New Xeuxis of Delft,” is
    represented by the <cite>Portrait of Olden Barnevelt</cite> (No. 2465) and three
    other portraits, one of which (No. 2466) is in a very bad state. Stiff
    but characteristic is the <cite>Portrait of a Woman</cite> (No. 2534), which was
    painted by Jan van Ravesteyn (1572–1657) in 1633, while his initials
    are also found on a panel (No. 2535) which was commissioned of him in
    the following year. Although Gerard Verspronck (1600–1651) was many
    years his junior, and in 1641, in the period of his maturity, achieved
    the <cite>Portrait of a Lady</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> (No. 2576<span class="smcap">a</span>), the top corners of
    which have been added, he painted on the lines of tradition, and showed
    little originality. He came under the influence of Frans Hals, under
    whose name his pictures often pass.</p>

  <h3 id="CORNELIS_JANSSEN">CORNELIS JANSSEN</h3>

  <p>Nor can it be said that the numerous portraits which Cornelis Janssen
    van Ceulen (1593–1664?) undertook in England, give signs of the new
    artistic impulse which was daily manifesting itself in Holland in the
    early works of Frans Hals. Janssen, who was baptized at the Dutch
    Reformed Church, Austin Friars, London, throve until the establishment
    in England of Van Dyck, before whom he quickly had to give way;
    although he withdrew to Kent and lived in retirement, he did not
    receive the Speaker’s warrant to pass beyond seas until 1643. That
    “Cornelius Johnson Picture Drawer” made use of pallid flesh tones and
    lifeless grey tones, is obvious from the two portraits (No. 2338 and
    No. 2339) exhibited in the Louvre.</p>

  <p>The very modern looking <cite>Portrait of a Young Man</cite> (No. 2303<span class="smcap">a</span>),
    signed “<span class="smcap">d. bailly</span>,” is officially held to be the work
    of a Leyden painter of that name who would appear to have been a
    contemporary of Cornelis Janssen.</p>

  <h3 id="FRANS_HALS">FRANS HALS</h3>

  <p>Although the great Dutch painter, Frans Hals (1580?–1666) was born
    at Antwerp, his parents were natives of Haarlem, whither he removed
    about 1600, and where he settled for the remainder of his eventful,
    irregular, and improvident career. This lusty and unromantic master by
    his forceful characterisation, his rapid wielding of his brush, and his
    frank realism, in a few years transformed the earlier portrait-making
    of Holland, and the rendering <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>of the commonplace and obvious
    likeness of an individual, as seen in the works of Moreelse and
    others, into the region of great art. He was by about a quarter of
    a century the senior of Rembrandt, who is the greatest genius among
    Dutch painters, and developed his art on logical lines. It is, however,
    necessary to know the outstanding facts of his personal history, the
    fluctuating circumstances under which he worked, and the grinding
    poverty of his latest period. Perhaps no other painter in the whole
    range of art was so affected by his environment as Hals.</p>

  <p>Whether he was a pupil of Cornelis Cornelissen, Hendrick Goltzius, and
    Karel van Mander (the Dutch Vasari), is not known with any certainty,
    and no picture painted by him earlier than 1613, when he may have been
    thirty-three years of age, is known to-day. Early in the year 1616,
    when he painted his famous <cite>Banquet of the Officers of the St. Joris
    Shooting Guild</cite>, one of his early masterpieces still preserved in the
    small gallery at Haarlem, he was summoned before the Burgomaster of
    the “town of the tulip,” and reprimanded for his cruelty to his first
    wife. Exactly a year later he married a second time, and as the years
    went on he became the father of at least six sons who adopted the
    profession of the painter but earned no permanent success. The Louvre
    possesses no example of his Doelen-pieces of archer-groups which won
    him his earliest fame in his own country, but is fortunate enough to
    contain the famous <cite>Gipsy Girl</cite> (No. 2384, <a href="#i_plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>), which alone
    would have earned for him the title of “the master of the laugh.”
    It passed through the Ménars sale in 1792 for 301 livres. The three
    pictures of the Beresteyn family were bought for £4000 in 1884, when
    his paintings were not as highly prized as they are to-day. They give
    an excellent idea of the virility his art had attained by about 1629.
    The best of these is the <cite>Portrait of Nicolaes van Beresteyn</cite> (No.
    2386), which is inscribed, “<span class="smcap">Aetat suae 40. 1629</span>.” His hands
    are superbly painted; while the companion <cite>Portrait</cite> (No. 2387) of
    his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> wife is equally striking. The large and imposing <cite>Portrait-Group
    of the Beresteyn Family</cite> (No. 2388) is marred by the excessive use in
    places of a strong red, and has been enlarged by the addition down the
    right side of the canvas of a strip about fourteen inches broad, but
    yet shows a certain felicity of grouping, and a joyous and exuberant
    outlook. <cite>The Portrait, of René Descartes, the French Philosopher</cite> (No.
    2383) is so simple in treatment and so easy in pose, that it makes an
    instant appeal to the student. Another <cite>Portrait of Descartes</cite> (No.
    78), by Sébastien Bourdon, is in this gallery, and a third was in the
    Arsène Houssaye collection. The <cite>Portrait of a Lady in a Black Dress</cite>
    (No. 2385, <a href="#i_plate28">Plate XXVIII.</a>) is unaffected and lifelike, while the subtle
    and hasty brushing in of the gloves could only have been done by a
    great painter. It seems to have been generally overlooked that a study
    for this picture is in the collection of Lord Ronald Gower, and has for
    some time past been on loan to the FitzWilliam Museum, Cambridge. In
    the study, however, the artist had not yet thought of the gloves.</p>

  <p>In 1654, Hals had to appear before a public notary of Haarlem at the
    instance of his landlord, who sued him for debt. The great Dutch
    painter in his testimony affirmed that his only possessions were two
    pictures by Vermander and Van Heemskerck, and three by himself and one
    of his sons, as well as three mattresses and bolsters, a cupboard and a
    table! The Louvre exhibits no pictorial record of Hals’s latest phase,
    when he was deserted by his friends, neglected by art patrons, and no
    longer possessed any inner moral support.</p>

  <p>The colouring of his early portraits is vigorous, the tone deep,
    and the execution careful; gradually he employs richer colouring,
    subordinates the local colours, and becomes broader in treatment. From
    about 1650 his olive-greens gradually take on a more ash-grey hue,
    until we are inclined to the belief that if the master <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>had been
    able to dispense with colour altogether, he would have willingly done
    so. It is then that the colours on his palette, like the outer world,
    became grey and black for him.</p>

  <p>This great master of the brush some time before his death had to avail
    himself of poor relief granted by the municipality of Haarlem, and

    portrait painters in the whole range of art.</p>

  <h3 id="DUTCH_INDEPENDENCE">DUTCH INDEPENDENCE</h3>

  <p>Holland after a terrible struggle had ultimately succeeded in throwing
    off the Spanish yoke before the art of Hals was on the wane. Dutch
    art then became gradually more independent, self-centred, democratic
    in outlook, and Protestant in tendency. Religious subjects became
    less frequent, and domestic scenes dealing with indoor and outdoor
    life were before long largely on the increase. Before we pass to the
    detailed study of the most striking characteristics of art in Holland
    in the last half of the seventeenth century, we must examine at some
    length the far-reaching influence and the world-famous achievements of
    Rembrandt, for whom Hals may be said to have prepared the way.</p>

  <h3 id="REMBRANDT">REMBRANDT</h3>

  <p>As his name denotes, Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn (1606–1669) was
    born on the banks of the Rhine, his father being a miller at Leyden.
    When fourteen years of age he entered the university of his native
    town and had a classical education, which stood him in good stead
    through his long and troubled career. Although he was at first placed
    as a pupil of Jacob van Swanenburgh, he at an early age removed to
    Amsterdam. There he worked under Pieter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> Lastman (1583–1633), whose
    <cite>Abraham’s Sacrificing Jacob</cite> (No. 2443<span class="smcap">a</span>) of 1616 is hung
    opposite the works of his illustrious pupil. The independent spirit
    of Rembrandt soon asserted itself, and as early as 1627 he placed his
    name on pictures which still exist, notably in the Berlin and Stuttgart
    museums. His earliest picture in the Louvre is the <cite>Old Man Reading</cite>
    (No. 2541<span class="smcap">a</span>), which is signed and dated 1630, and was presented
    by M. Kaempfen, a former Director of this gallery, on his retirement.
    Three years later came the two small and very similar versions (No.
    2540 and No. 2541) of the <cite>Philosopher in Meditation</cite>, the former of
    which is signed and dated; in 1633 was painted the <cite>Portrait of the
    Artist</cite> (No. 2552), while another oval picture of the same subject (No.
    2553) is inscribed 1634. In this early period the artist was in the
    habit of portraying members of his own family, who were naturally his
    most accessible models.</p>

  <p>At this moment of his career Rembrandt had to measure himself with
    many rivals in Amsterdam, notably with Thomas de Keyser (1596?–1667),
    whose <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 2438<span class="smcap">a</span>) was formerly in the
    Rodolphe Kann collection, while a half-length <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite>
    (No. 2438<span class="smcap">b</span>), also by de Keyser, was formerly at Versailles.
    From the trammels and restrictions which the art of de Keyser would
    have been likely to impose on a less gifted and original mind,
    Rembrandt readily set himself free; and he must have had great hopes
    for the future when, in 1634, he took to wife the wealthy Saskia van
    Uylenborch. However, the oval <cite>Portrait of Himself wearing a black cap</cite>
    (No. 2554), dated 1637, is of marked inferiority to the dignified and
    deeply religious panel, <cite>The Archangel Raphael leaving Tobias and his
    Father Tobit</cite> (No. 2536), of the same year. A year later he must have
    painted the <cite>Portrait of an Old Man</cite> (No. 2544), and his first pure
    landscape.</p>

  <p>The influence of domestic bereavements on Rembrandt’s art is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>clearly reflected in the choice of his subjects, in their more
    intimate setting, and in the deep feeling which evidently inspired
    them. No better example of this side of his character and his art could
    be found than the <cite>Holy Family in the Carpenter’s Shop</cite> (No. 2542),
    which he painted in 1640. In that year his mother died, an event which
    followed rapidly on the death of his two infant daughters and his son,
    and his wife’s frequent illness. He, however, still went on painting
    such varied compositions as the <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 2546), of
    1645, and the <cite>Woman Bathing</cite> (No. 2550), which he achieved two years
    later.</p>

  <p>The famous <cite>Night-Watch</cite>, in the Amsterdam Gallery, testifies to his
    inventive faculty in 1642, the year in which the death of his beloved
    Saskia caused him intense grief. From this he never really recovered,
    as we see from the frequency with which during the remainder of his
    life he painted pathetic subjects. What artist in the whole history
    of painting has been able to impart to his rendering of the <cite>Good
    Samaritan</cite> the kindly solicitude of the principal character in this
    parable, and the feeling of complete collapse seen in the body of the
    wounded man, as Rembrandt has done in his superb canvas (No. 2537) of
    1648 in this gallery? No less poignant is the grief depicted on the
    face of the barefooted Man of Sorrows in the <cite>Christ and the Pilgrims
    at Emmaus</cite> (No. 2539, <a href="#i_plate29">Plate XXIX.</a>) of the same year. Here we see
    convincing proof of the dexterous use that the Dutch “magician-painter”
    could make of chiaroscuro, which he has handled with such masterly
    effect in the <cite>Portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels</cite> (No. 2547, <a href="#i_plate30">Plate XXX.</a>).
    All these paintings belong to the same period as the soul-moving
    <cite>Polish Rider</cite>, which in 1910 passed from the collection of Count
    Tarnowski at Dzikow in Galicia into that of Mr. H. C. Frick in New
    York for £60,000. The <cite>Portrait of a Man holding a Bâton</cite> (No. 2551),
    in the La Caze collection in this gallery, was painted three years
    later than the <cite>Bathsheba</cite>, or <cite>Woman Bathing</cite> (No. 2549),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> of 1654.
    The wonderfully realistic and in no way repellent <cite>Carcase of an Ox</cite>
    in this gallery (No. 2548), like the picture of the same subject at
    Glasgow, is an achievement of a very different kind, and belongs to the
    year 1655.</p>

  <p>The Louvre authorities have been well advised in recent years in
    hanging all the pictures by Rembrandt in this collection in one Bay of
    the Long Gallery. Here now we may study the <cite>Portrait of a Young Man</cite>
    (No. 2545), the wonderful and rather later <cite>Portrait of the Artist at
    his Easel at the age of Fifty-four</cite> (No. 2555), and the striking <cite>St.
    Matthew</cite> (No. 2538) of 1661. Before these three works were painted, the
    great Dutch master had been declared bankrupt, the sale of his most
    treasured possessions realising a ridiculously small sum in the winter
    of 1657.</p>

  <p>Although Rembrandt’s own standard of morality offended his neighbours,
    and his relations with Hendrickje Stoffels seem to have caused much
    scandal in Amsterdam, we are not concerned with the morals of one of
    the greatest and most esteemed of the world’s painters, but only with
    his <i lang="fr">œuvre</i>, a high place in which must be accorded to the <cite>Portrait of
    Hendrickje Stoffels and her Child as Venus and Cupid</cite> (No. 2543), which
    was painted in 1662, the year that the large <cite>Syndics</cite>, now in the
    Amsterdam Gallery, was completed.</p>

  <p>He is also to be credited with the alternative version of the <cite>Pilgrims
    at Emmaus</cite> (No. 2555<span class="smcap">a</span>), a painting of the same date, which for
    many years was at Compiègne, where, however, it passed only as a school
    picture. This profoundly creative painter, who learnt as time went on
    to handle his chiaroscuro with increased effect, was also an etcher of
    the highest order.</p>

  <p>We may here note that the art of Jan Lievens (1607–1674), a
    fellow-pupil with Rembrandt under Pieter Lastman, is seen in the large
    but far from imposing <cite>Visitation</cite> (No. 2444).</p>

  </div>

  <p>That Govaert Flinck (1615–1660) was a pupil of Rembrandt, is evident
    from his <cite>Announcement to the Shepherds</cite> (No. 2372) rather than from
    his <cite>Portrait of a Young Lady</cite> (No. 2373), a signed work of 1641.
    Ferdinand Bol (1617–1680) was a pupil and imitator of the great Dutch
    master, and his <cite>Portrait of a Mathematician</cite> (No. 2330) is one of his
    best paintings; but his <cite>Philosopher in Meditation</cite> (No. 2328) compares
    most unfavourably with Rembrandt’s two early pictures of the same
    subject which hang opposite it.</p>

  <p>The ineffectual productions of Jan Victoors (1620–1670) include the
    <cite>Portrait of a Young Lady</cite> (No. 2371), a typical example of the “niche”
    portrait which became so popular, and a large <cite>Isaac blessing Jacob</cite>
    (No. 2370), which vividly recalls his small canvas in the Dulwich
    College Gallery that in less critical days passed as a Rembrandt.</p>

  <p>G. van den Eeckhout (1621–1674) in his picture (No. 2364) shows his
    dependence on Rembrandt; and Cornells Drost’s repulsive <cite>Bathsheba</cite>
    (No. 2359<span class="smcap">a</span>) has no claim to be regarded as a “<i lang="fr">fort bonne
    peinture</i>,” as a French critic has thought fit to term it.</p>

  <h3 id="VAN_DER_HELST">VAN DER HELST</h3>

  <p>Bartholomeus van der Heist (1612–1670), a native of Haarlem, who
    painted under the early Dutch master, Nicholas Elias, surnamed
    Pickenoy, and subsequently worked at Amsterdam, has fully signed his
    <cite>Shooting Prize</cite> (No. 2394, <a href="#i_plate31">Plate XXXI.</a>), which is dated 1653. It has
    been regarded as a replica on a very reduced scale of <cite>The Officers
    of the Brotherhood of St. Sebastian at Amsterdam</cite>, in the Amsterdam
    Gallery, which, curiously enough, bears the date 1657, and is also
    signed on a slate.</p>

  <p>Pieter van der Faes, who is better known as Sir Peter Lely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
    (1618–1680), after painting at Haarlem in the school of Pieter de
    Grebber, went to England in 1641. He there succeeded Van Dyck as Court
    painter, and at the Restoration became the favourite Royal painter. The
    affectation and mannerism of his <cite>Windsor Beauties</cite>, now at Hampton
    Court, is well known. He had a certain facility in painting</p>

  <div class="center small">“The sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul.”</div>

  <p>Three pictures (Nos. 2367–2369) are placed to his credit here, but</p>

  <div class="center small">“The bugle eyeball and the cheek of cream”</div>

  <p class="noindent">have done their magic now.</p>

  <p>The name of H. van Vliet (1611?–1675) is, doubtless, correctly
    connected with two portraits on canvas (Nos. 2605 and 2605<span class="smcap">a</span>),
    while his contemporaries, Cornelis Saftleven (1606–1681) and D. van
    Santvoort (1610–1680), are represented by <cite>The Artist’s Portrait</cite> (No.
    2562) and the <cite>Pilgrims at Emmaus</cite> (No. 2564) respectively. Jakob van
    Loo (1614–1670), who became a naturalised Frenchman, may be judged by
    his diploma picture (No. 2451) and a very poor <cite>Nude Female</cite> (No. 2452).</p>

  <p>Such mediocre producers of uninspired and unconvincing panels as Dirk
    Hals (1591–1656), the brother and pupil of Frans Hals, whose <cite>Festive
    Repast</cite> (No. 2389) hangs in Room XXIII.; Cornelis van Poelenburg
    (1586–1667), whose art is here admirably illustrated (Nos. 2518–2523);
    Hendrick Pot (1585–1657), who evidently derived some satisfaction from
    the elaborate inscription he has placed on his quite ineffectual,
    but fortunately diminutive, <cite>Portrait of Charles I.</cite> (No. 2525); and
    the little-known and less-esteemed L. F. Zustris (1526–1600), whose
    absurd <cite>Venus and Love</cite> (No. 2640) shows what a waste of time it was
    for him to study under Titian in Italy—these and many more worked
    as “business artists” for undiscriminating patrons. In the same
    category come Adriaen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>van de Venne (No. 2601), Pieter Codde (No.
    2339<span class="smcap">a</span>), Jacob Duck (No. 2360–2361), and A. Palamedesz (No.

  <h3 id="GENRE_PAINTERS">GENRE PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>This rough sketch must suffice for our study of the History and
    Portrait Painters of Holland. Although, of course, portraiture played
    a most important part throughout the whole range of Dutch art, we must
    now deal with those of their contemporaries and successors who are
    classed as painters of genre subjects, Interiors, Conversation-pieces,
    and Rustic Scenes. The compositions of these men at first show high
    technical excellence, and a refined feeling for light and shade;
    they depict simple scenes and homely incidents which make a wide
    appeal in any age. By the end of the seventeenth century their scenes
    become festive, and eventually boisterous, and so degenerate into
    unimaginative renderings of far-fetched incidents which are treated
    with a parade of mere imitative skill. In the last phase of their art
    the subjects become even more uninviting, the panels are smoothly
    painted, and all originality disappears.</p>

  <h3 id="ADRIAEN_VAN_OSTADE">ADRIAEN VAN OSTADE</h3>

  <p>Adriaen van Ostade (1610–1685), as a pupil of Frans Hals at Haarlem,
    occupies an important position in his school. He is seen to very great
    advantage at the Louvre. From his early <cite>Interior of a Cabaret</cite> (No.
    2506), which is signed on a form</p>

  <div class="center small">“A. V. OSTADE 1641,”</div>

  <p class="noindent">we see the direction his life’s work was to take; and his <cite>Interior of
    a Cottage</cite> (No. 2498) of the following year, strengthens that view.
    although <cite>Reading the Gazette</cite> (No. 2505), of 1653, is painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> on
    a very small panel, it heightens our appreciation of this able and
    careful painter, who, a year later, must have spent a long time in
    the completion of a <cite>Family Group</cite>, which traditionally passes as the
    <cite>Family of the Artist</cite> (No. 2495). The <cite>Toper</cite> (No. 2401), of 1668, and
    the intensely realistic <cite>Smoker</cite> (No. 2500), are highly characteristic,
    while the <cite>Schoolmaster</cite> (No. 2496) shows great observation. The <cite>Fish
    Market</cite> (No. 2497), the <cite>Business Man in his Study</cite> (No. 2499), the
    <cite>Man Drinking</cite> (No. 2502), the <cite>Man Reading</cite> (No. 2503), the <cite>Reading</cite>
    (No. 2504), and the <cite>Interior of a School</cite> (No. 2507), are both in
    subject and handling good examples of his methods, which were affected
    by a study of Adriaen Brouwer and Rembrandt.</p>

  <p>Adriaen van Ostade was the elder brother and the master of Isack van
    Ostade (1621–1649), who is equally well represented at the Louvre.
    although he painted two <cite>Interiors</cite> (Nos. 2512 and 2514), a <cite>Toit à
    porcs</cite> (No. 2513), a <cite>Halt</cite> (No. 2509), and an overcrowded <cite>Travellers
    Halting</cite> (No. 2508), his best works, here as elsewhere, represent
    landscapes and frozen river scenes.</p>

  <p>Adriaen van Ostade had also as pupils Cornelis Bega (1620–1664), by
    whom the Louvre possesses a very late <cite>Rustic Interior</cite> (No. 2312), of
    1662; and H. M. Sorgh, called Rokes (1611?–1670), three of whose panels
    (Nos. 2571–2573) are exhibited.</p>

  <h3 id="GERARD_DOU">GERARD DOU</h3>

  <p>Gerard Dou (1613–1675) was in his day a highly popular and prosperous
    painter of petty tragedies. As a boy of fifteen he entered the studio
    of “the skilled and far-famed Mr. Rembrandt,” who was, however, his
    senior by only seven years. One is apt to tire of his irritating
    parade of cleverness in the manipulation of light and shade effects,
    and over-scrupulous and niggling treatment of detail. Yet it is these
    very qualities that brought him financial success when in later life
    Rembrandt was receiving scanty treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>ment at the hands of the art
    patrons of Holland. The <cite>Dentist</cite> (No. 2355) is an early work. Dou’s
    <cite>Portrait of an Old Lady</cite> (No. 2358) is now held to be a <cite>Portrait of
    Rembrandt’s Mother</cite>, and is regarded as the companion picture to the
    <cite>Old Man Reading</cite> (No. 2567), by Dou’s pupil, Godfried Schalcken. The
    <cite>Grocer’s Shop</cite> (No. 2350), which has been, with needless precision,
    “ranked about the seventh best of this master’s productions,” is signed
    in full on the slate, and dated 1647 on the mortar, while the <cite>Cook
    with a Dead Cock</cite> (No. 2353) is signed on the window-sill, and dated 1650.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <p>In a well-appointed room, lighted by an arched window on the left, an
      old woman is seated in an arm-chair. The sick woman, who raises her
      eyes to heaven and is taking a spoonful of medicine from a young woman,
      gives her right hand to a girl who kneels on the left by her side.
      Towards the right stands the doctor, who holds up to the light a glass
      full of liquid. A chandelier hangs in the centre, and on the right are
      a large tapestry curtain and a wine-cooler.</p>
    <p class="noindent">Signed on the edge of the book placed on the reading-desk in the left
      foreground:—</p>
    <div class="center">“1663. <span class="smcap">g. dov. ovt. 65 jaer</span>.”</div>

    <p class="noindent">2 ft. 8¾ in. × 2 ft. 2½ in. (0·83 × 0·67.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <cite>Trumpeter</cite> (No. 2351) is perhaps the pendant to the <cite>Girl at a
    Window</cite>, of 1657, now in the Rothschild collection at Waddesdon Manor.
    On the window-ledge in the <cite>Trumpeter</cite> we see the same silver flagon
    and a dish that also appear in the <cite>Dropsical Woman</cite> (No. 2348, <a href="#i_plate32">Plate
    XXXII.</a>), a world-famous, but not on that account a great, picture. It
    bears a somewhat enigmatical inscription:</p>

  <div class="center small">“1663. G. DOV. OVT. 65 JAER”</div>

  <p class="noindent">on the edge of the book placed on the reading-desk. Dou
    in 1663, the year here given, was only fifty years of age, and the
    statement of age in the second half of the inscription may be a later
    addition, or capable of another interpretation. The light comes in from
    the window on the left. The woman who is dying of dropsy is receiving
    a dose of medicine, while her daughter in grief kneels and kisses her
    hand, and the doctor holds up to the light the vial, the contents
    of which he is carefully examining. The artist in this his largest
    picture is at much pains to show the dexterity with which he can paint
    the fabric of the dresses, the large tapestry hanging in folds on the
    right, and the reflection of light on the chandelier. This panel, which
    is Dou’s masterpiece and is in an excellent state of preservation, was
    originally contained in an ebony case, the outside of which (in two
    pieces) was formerly the still-life painting of a <cite>Silver Ewer and
    Dish</cite> (No. 2349).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

  <p>The <cite>Man weighing Gold</cite> (No. 2354) is signed in full, and dated 1664;
    elaborate care and much time have been expended, if not wasted, on
    every wrinkle in his face, and every hair in his white beard. It
    has points of analogy with Quentin Matsys’s <cite>Banker and his Wife</cite>
    (No. 2029), which was painted in Flanders nearly a century and a
    half earlier. Dou’s meticulous art is also exemplified in the <cite>Old
    Man Reading</cite> (No. 2357), <cite>Reading the Bible</cite> (No. 2356), the <cite>Dutch
    Cook</cite> (No. 2352), and the highly characteristic but quite negligible
    <cite>Portrait of the Painter</cite> (No. 2359). In many respects this type of
    picture warns us that within a few years of Dou’s death, in 1675, the
    art of Holland passed into decadence.</p>

  <h3 id="DOUS_PUPILS">DOU’S PUPILS</h3>

  <p>He had several pupils. Of these Quiryn van Brekelenkam (1620?–1668)
    holds a respectable place among the Small Masters of Holland, as we
    see from his <cite>Consultation</cite> (No. 2337) in this collection rather than
    from his <cite>Monk Writing</cite> (No. 2338). Herman van Swanevelt (1620–1655),
    who from his journeys south earned the name of Herman of Italy, gives
    us three <cite>Landscapes</cite> (Nos. 2584–2586). Karel de Moor (1656–1738),
    a native of Leyden, who has signed his <cite>Dutch Family</cite> (No. 2477),
    worked under both Dou and Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635–1681). The
    latter owes much of his technique and meticulous work to Dou, as is
    revealed by a hasty inspection of his <cite>Tea Party</cite> (No. 2471), with
    two over-dressed women taking tea, and three other panels (Nos. 2469,
    2470, and 2472). Ary de Vois (1632–1680) was a pupil of the German
    painter N. Knupfer and of his own countryman Abraham van den Tempel
    (1622–1672), who is here represented by a <cite>Portrait of a Lady with an
    Apple</cite> (No. 2586<span class="smcap">a</span>); but he also came under the influence of
    the painter of the <cite>Dropsical Woman</cite> (<a href="#i_plate32">Plate XXXII.</a>), as is testified
    by his small interior <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 2606), his <cite>Portrait
    of a Painter at his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>Easel</cite> (No. 2607), and his feeble <cite>Woman
    cutting a Lemon</cite> (No. 2608). Traces of Dou’s art are seen in J. A. van
    Staveren’s (1624?–1668) <cite>Philosopher in his Study</cite> (No. 2577); but P.
    C. van Slingelandt (1640–1691) was a direct pupil. His <cite>Dutch Family</cite>
    (No. 2568) is said to have been bought by Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> from an
    English brewer, and the <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 2569) and <cite>Kitchen
    Utensils</cite> (No. 2570) have long been in the collection. The <cite>Magdalene</cite>
    (No. 2570<span class="smcap">a</span>) and <cite>St. Jerome</cite> (No. 2570<span class="smcap">b</span>) were

  <h3 id="GERARD_TERBORCH">GERARD TERBORCH</h3>

  <p>Gerard Terborch (1617–1681) was the creator of the
    “Conversation-piece,” and one of the earliest to portray the well born
    engaged in music lessons and similar occupations; he was one of the
    greatest of the Dutch “small-masters,” and in every way the superior
    of the uninspired Dou. Terborch invites us to join him in the fine
    decorum of a noble chamber where the appointments are carefully tended,
    while its occupants give themselves up to cultured, if not perhaps
    deeply intellectual, pursuits. We forget all about the carousing and
    bestial profligates who people the taverns of Jan Steen and much
    less accomplished painters, and watch the refined fingers stray over
    the keyboard of the open spinet or sweep the strings of a well-made
    mandoline, as in the <cite>Concert</cite> (No. 2589, <a href="#i_plate33">Plate XXXIII.</a>). Equally fine
    are the two <cite>Music Lessons</cite> (No. 2588 and No. 2591), the former being
    signed and dated 1660.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Military Galant</cite> (No. 2587) exhibits Terborch’s dexterity in the
    rendering of reflected light on a red tablecloth, although the subject
    has an innuendo which hardly adds to its charm. The <cite>Ecclesiastical
    Assembly</cite> (No. 2590) is only a small sketch on panel, and affords but
    a feeble echo of this painter’s masterpiece, the <cite>Ratification of the
    Peace of Münster</cite>, in the National Gallery. Terborch was a pupil of
    his father, who had visited Italy, and he studied also under Pieter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
    Molyn the Elder at Haarlem previous to visiting England in 1635. He
    travelled much more extensively than most of his contemporaries, and
    went to Spain during the best period of art in the Peninsula. He does
    not seem to have been dependent on his professional success for his
    living, which was passed in easy circumstances. Nor did he busy himself
    as a teacher, his only direct pupil being Caspar Netscher (1639–1684),
    who gives us a <cite>Music Lesson</cite> (No. 2486), of the approved stamp, and a
    <cite>Violoncello Lesson</cite> (No. 2487).</p>

  <h3 id="JAN_STEEN">JAN STEEN</h3>

  <p>It is not known for certain whether Jan Steen (1626?–1679) was a pupil
    of Nicholaes Knupfer, a native of Leipzig who resided for a time at
    Leyden, but he certainly worked under Adriaen van Ostade at Haarlem,
    and later became a pupil of Jan van Goyen, whose daughter Margaretha
    he married as his first wife. Steen certainly leased a brewery in
    Delft for six years, and he is frequently mentioned in the archives of
    that town about 1656; he subsequently kept a tavern in the Langebrug
    in Leyden in 1672. His art is vivacious if not boisterous, and the
    strength and versatility he displayed in the nine hundred pictures with
    which he is justly credited give him a high place among the artists of
    Holland in the seventeenth century. The frequency with which he painted
    the <cite>Interior of a Tavern</cite> (No. 2578) has suggested that he carried on
    the tradition of the Flemish-Dutch roysterer Adriaen Brouwer; but such
    scenes, magnificently as they are handled, are apt to become boring in
    time. This large canvas is dated 1674, and the coat of arms of Charles
    <span class="smcap">v.</span> is fastened on to the balcony in which are spectators.
    The <cite>Merry Company at Table</cite> (No. 2579) is somewhat sketchy in parts,
    but the lighting is well regulated, and the canvas is signed in full
    on the back of a blue-covered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>chair to the right. That the <cite>Bad
    Company</cite> (No. 2580, <a href="#i_plate34">Plate XXXIV.</a>) is admirably painted will be conceded
    by all, but refinement is not its distinguishing feature. A young
    man dressed in a red jacket is sleeping with his head on the lap of
    a girl, while another girl is relieving him of his watch. The scene
    is laid in a tavern, on the floor of which are painted with wonderful
    precision a number of tiny objects. It was not Steen’s habit to paint
    representations of cultured society such as Terborch delighted in.</p>

  <h3 id="PIETER_DE_HOOCH">PIETER DE HOOCH</h3>

  <p>The Louvre contains only two paintings by Pieter de Hooch, who was born
    in 1629 at Rotterdam, a town which played a relatively unimportant part
    in Dutch painting. He also lived at Delft and Leyden. The <cite>Interior
    of a Dutch House, with a Woman preparing Vegetables</cite> (No. 2414), is
    a good example, and is fully signed in the bottom left-hand corner.
    The <cite>Dutch Interior, with a Lady playing Cards</cite> (No. 2415, <a href="#i_plate35">Plate
    XXXV.</a>), is full of incidents, contains six figures, and is signed
    on the base of one of the columns supporting the mantelpiece in the
    left foreground. No museum in the world exhibits the art of Pieter de
    Hooch in such excellence as does the National Gallery, which contains
    three masterpieces from his hands that have indirectly been the cause
    of assessing the whole of the artist’s life-work on too generous a
    basis. It is indisputable that during the last ten years of his life,
    of which nothing is known later than the signature and date, 1677,
    on the <cite>Music Party</cite> in the collection of Baron H. A. Steengracht at
    The Hague, his art deteriorated very considerably both in colouring
    and draughtsmanship. He may well have been a pupil of Karel Fabritius
    (1624–1654), but it is almost incredible that he can have been a pupil
    of the Italianiser Nicholaes Berchem, as Houbraken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> ventured to assert.
    This museum contains nothing by Ochtervelt, many of whose pictures have
    from time to time been accepted as the work of Pieter de Hooch.</p>

  <p>From the shortlived artist Karel Fabritius derives the almost
    incomparable master Jan Vermeer van Delft (1642–1675), whose fifty
    authentic pictures are to-day among those most coveted by collectors.
    As a <em>painter</em> skilled in the technicalities of his profession Vermeer
    must be accorded the highest rank. The subtle and mysterious handling
    of his <cite>Lace Maker</cite> (No. 2456, <a href="#i_plate36">Plate XXXVI.</a>), with its cool colour
    scheme and dominant tones of blue and lemon-yellow, make it difficult
    for us to realise that until twenty years ago his works were neglected.
    Indeed, this small canvas was acquired in 1870 at the Vis Blokhuyzen
    sale for the ridiculous sum of £290. Jan Vermeer (or Van der Meer)
    van Delft is not to be confused with Jan Van der Meer of Haarlem
    (1628–1691), who is included in the official catalogue as the painter
    of the <cite>Outside of an Inn</cite> (No. 2455, marked No. 2022 on the frame). It
    is fully signed, and bears the date 1652.</p>

  <h3 id="NICOLAS_MAES">NICOLAS MAES</h3>

  <p>One of the last lingering influences of Rembrandt is seen in the
    art of Nicolas Maes (1632–1693). The genre pictures of his early
    period are so vastly superior to his later portraits that it was
    formerly assumed that there might well have been two artists of the
    same name. He certainly delighted in painting several versions,
    which vary considerably in size, of <cite>Grace before Meat</cite> (No. 2454).
    In his pictures we see the mind that broods, and women who meditate
    rather than act. The best examples of his domestic scenes are finely
    graduated, although the sadness of advancing age becomes monotonous in
    time.</p>

    <h3 id="GABRIEL_METSU">GABRIEL METSU</h3>
  </div>

  <p>A high place among the painters of “Conversation-pieces” must be
    accorded to Gabriel Metsu (1630?–1667), a shortlived artist who was
    born at Leyden and learnt the first principles of his art from Dou. As
    early as 1644 he seems to have earned some reputation as a painter,
    his signature appearing on his <cite>Court Physician</cite> in that year. He came
    under the influence of Rembrandt, and in later life practised as a
    painter at Amsterdam, where he died.</p>

  <p>Metsu, whose work is at first sight not easily distinguishable from
    Terborch’s, acquired a facility in the control of the expression and
    the ever-varying gesture of the hands in his pictures, that was denied
    to many of his contemporaries. Instances of this are the figure of the
    Christ writing a long Latin inscription on the ground in the <cite>Woman
    taken in Adultery</cite> (No. 2457), the ease with which the young lady in
    a white satin dress runs her fingers over the keys of the spinet in
    the <cite>Music Lesson</cite> (No. 2460), and the treatment of the <cite>Dutch Lady</cite>
    (No. 2462), who holds a jug in her right hand. The last-named panel is
    evidently the companion to the very thinly painted <cite>Dutch Cook peeling
    Apples</cite> (No. 2463), which is signed “<span class="smcap">g. metsu.</span>” Perhaps
    his best outdoor scene of humble life is the <cite>Vegetable Market at
    Amsterdam</cite> (No. 2458), although his handling of the trees suggests that
    his forte was the Conversation-piece of Dutch tradition, and that he
    would not have risen to high rank as a landscape painter. The placing
    of the signature on a letter, which in this instance lies on the
    ground, is a favourite device with Metsu. He has derived much pleasure
    from the treatment of the textures of the tablecloth, the curtain, and
    the chair in the <cite>Officer visiting a Lady</cite> (No. 2459). The <cite>Alchemist</cite>
    (No. 2461) may be the companion picture to the <cite>Sportsman</cite> in the
    Gallery at The Hague. Much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> speculative criticism has been indulged in
    by critics as to whether the so-called <cite>Portrait of Admiral Cornelis
    Tromp</cite> (No. 2464) represents that admiral, and some doubt has also been
    cast on its attribution to Metsu.</p>

  <h3 id="LANDSCAPE_PAINTERS">LANDSCAPE PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>The naturalistic treatment of the landscape background in the religious
    pictures of Jan van Eyck and his successors, Memlinc, Bouts, Hugo van
    der Goes, and other painters in the Netherlands, in time brought about
    the promotion of landscape painting to an independent art. Among the
    earlier Dutch artists who approached the study of Nature were Arent
    Arentzen (1586?–1635?), as we see from his <cite>Landscape with a Fisherman</cite>
    (No. 2300<span class="smcap">a</span>), and Roeland Roghman, who was born a year
    later than Jan van Goyen, and lived as late as 1685. He painted the
    <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2555<span class="smcap">b</span>), which was formerly in the Paul Mantz
    collection. Indeed, several Dutchmen of the period sought to commit to
    panel views of nature, as in the case of Pieter de Bloot (1600–1652),
    who gives us a <cite>Landscape with a River</cite> (No. 2327<span class="smcap">b</span>).</p>

  <p>The romantic feeling which so often pervades the background of
    Rembrandt’s paintings, and is so apparent in such etchings as the
    <cite>Three Trees</cite>, can only be touched on here. This new tendency is best
    exemplified in the works of Jan van Goyen (1596–1656), who may be
    regarded as the founder of a self-centred school of landscape painting
    in Holland; but it was his ever handy sketch-book that enabled him to
    outstrip his rivals in this branch of Dutch art. He is seen to great
    advantage in his very fine <cite>Banks of a Dutch River</cite> (No. 2375), his
    superb <cite>River View with eight Men in a Boat</cite> (No. 2378), a signed and
    dated work of 1649, a large light-brown-toned <cite>River in Holland</cite> (No.
    2377), a good <cite>Banks of a Canal</cite> (No. 2379), as well as a <cite>Dutch Canal</cite>
    (No. 2376) and a <cite>Dutch River</cite> (No. 2377).</p>

  <p>Aert van der Neer (1603–1677) painted with strong contrasts of light,
    as in his <cite>Banks of a Dutch Canal</cite> (No. 2483); and his monogram is
    to be found on the seat at the foot of a tree in his <cite>Dutch Village</cite>
    (No. 2484), where his propensity for painting moonlight scenes is well
    illustrated. Herman Saftleven’s (1609–1685) <cite>Banks of the Rhine</cite> (No.
    2563); Jan Asselyn’s <cite>View of the Lamentano Bridge on the Teverone</cite>
    (No. 2301), <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2302), and <cite>Ruins in the Roman Campagna</cite>
    (No. 2303); and the two <cite>Landscapes</cite> (Nos. 2332 and 2333) by Jan Both
    (1610–1652), who worked in Rome and painted Italian landscapes under
    the influence of the French artist Claude Lorrain, show the gradual
    introduction of foreign influences. Joris van der Hagen (died 1669)
    takes a new line in the representation of a very low horizon in his
    <cite>Environs de Haarlem</cite> (No. 2382); but his <cite>Landscape with Peasants
    crossing a Ford</cite> (No. 2381) is dull in tone and composed of unrelated
    parts.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Banks of a River</cite> (No. 2561<span class="smcap">d</span>) is a superb example of the
    art of Salomon van Ruysdael (1600?–1670), one of the founders of the
    Haarlem school of landscape, and the uncle of Jacob van Ruisdael. The
    <cite>Large Tower</cite> (No. 2561<span class="smcap">c</span>) gives a better idea of his power
    than the <cite>Ford</cite> (No. 2561<span class="smcap">b</span>). Another painter in the same
    school, Cornelis Decker (1618?–1678), has a <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2346).
    although Isack van Ostade at times gave himself up to trivial subjects,
    as we have already seen, the merit of his frozen river scenes (Nos.
    2510, 2511, 2515) is firmly established, and the happy way in which
    he combined a genuine appreciation of nature with great skill in the
    placing and treatment of his figures has earned for him a high place
    among the Dutch landscape painters.</p>

  <h3 id="AELBERT_CUYP">AELBERT CUYP</h3>

  <p>Unlike most of the artists of his time in Holland, Aelbert Cuyp
    (1620–1691) was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, his social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
    position and his good fortune in money matters freeing him from the
    poverty which Hobbema and others endured. He painted portraits with
    much skill, as we see from his <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 2345<span class="smcap">a</span>)
    and his <cite>Portrait of a Boy and a Girl with a Goat</cite> (No. 2344); but he
    is best known as a cattle painter, his sturdy cattle being artistically
    grouped in thick green pastures flooded with sunshine, as in his
    <cite>Herdsman with Cattle</cite> (No. 2341). He attained much success also with
    his riding pictures, and the <cite>Starting for the Ride</cite> (No. 2342) and the
    <cite>Riding Party</cite> (No. 2343) are in every way preferable to his <cite>Boats
    on a Rough Sea</cite> (No. 2345). Following his usual habit, he has placed
    no date on any of these six pictures. He had no pupil in the proper
    sense of the term; but a host of imitators, such as Jacob van Stry
    and the much later English Royal Academician Sidney Cooper, failed
    ignominiously in their feeble attempts to copy his methods.</p>

  <p>Jan Wynants was another landscape painter in the Haarlem School,
    although he settled in Amsterdam and died there in 1682. His <cite>Outskirts
    of a Forest</cite> (No. 2636) is signed and dated 1668, and is superior to
    the <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2637) which bears his own signature as well as
    that of Adriaen van de Velde, who on numerous occasions inserted the
    figures for him. Wynants has also placed his name on a small <cite>Landscape
    with Sportsman and Falconer</cite> (No. 2638).</p>

  <p>Adriaen van de Velde has been careful to sign and date each of the
    seven pictures by which he is represented (Nos. 2593–2599). By Allart
    van Everdingen (1621–1675), who travelled in Norway and painted rocky
    scenes and waterfalls, we find two <cite>Landscapes</cite> (Nos. 2365 and 2366).</p>

  <h3 id="JACOB_VAN_RUISDAEL">JACOB VAN RUISDAEL</h3>

  <p>The greatest of all Dutch landscape painters, with the possible
    exception of Jan van Goyen, is Jacob van Ruisdael (1628?–1682),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> who
    occupied himself more especially with rushing waterfalls and undulating
    country. His <cite>Storm on the Coast</cite> (No. 2558) is a fine achievement, but
    his best picture in this collection is the <cite>Landscape</cite> (no No.), which
    was bequeathed by Baron Arthur de Rothschild. His <cite>Woody Landscape</cite>
    (No. 2559), the <cite>Road</cite> (No. 2559<span class="smcap">a</span>), <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2561),
    and the <cite>Entrance to a Wood</cite> (No. 2561<span class="smcap">a</span>), cannot, however,
    compare with his <cite>Sunny Landscape</cite> (No. 2560), which bears the artist’s
    monogram.</p>

  <h3 id="HOBBEMA">HOBBEMA</h3>

  <p>The talents of Meindert Hobbema (1638–1709) were so disregarded by his
    countrymen that in disgust he, at the age of thirty, took a humble post
    in the Customs. His woody scenes seen in the pale sunlight of the early
    afternoon are not copied from any chance scenery, but composed; and his
    <cite>Water Mill</cite> (No. 2404), fine though it is, contains passages that will
    be met with elsewhere. The <cite>Farm</cite> (No. 2404<span class="smcap">a</span>) is a very good
    picture, as also is the <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2403) from the Nieuwenhuys
    collection. A very large number of painters, including Wyntrack, who
    gives us a <cite>Farm</cite> (No. 2639), painted the figures into the foregrounds
    of Hobbema’s best works.</p>

  <h3 id="PHILIPS_WOUWERMAN">PHILIPS WOUWERMAN</h3>

  <p>In a large number of Philips Wouwerman’s pictures the landscapes are
    of secondary importance to the figures; and although the execution
    is careful and conscientious, the frequenter of picture galleries is
    apt to tire of his make-believe genre-pieces, landscapes with horses,
    riders, sportsmen, soldiers, robbers, gipsies, and the like. The Louvre
    presents an imposing array of fifteen of the twelve hundred or more
    pictures by Philips Wouwerman (1619–1668), and his brother and pupil
    Pieter is credited with a poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> but historically interesting <cite>View of
    the Porte de Nesles, Paris</cite>, in 1664 (No. 2635).</p>

  <p>It will be convenient here to group Adam Pynacker (1622–1673) with his
    three pictures, Willem Romeyn (1624?–1696?) with one, Abraham Begeyn
    (1637?–1697) with one, Guilliam de Heusch (1625?–1692) with one, Dirk
    van den Berghen (1645–1690?) with two, and Glauber (1646–1726) with
    a single <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 2374) in which the figures are inserted by
    Gerard de Lairesse. Mention must, however, be made of Paul Potter,
    the highly esteemed cattle painter, who died in 1654 at the early age
    of twenty-nine. One of his latest canvases is the <cite>Cows and Sheep in
    a Field</cite> (No. 2527), of 1652; but his <cite>Horse in a Field</cite> (No. 2528)
    of the following year, and the <cite>Wood at The Hague</cite> (No. 2529), give
    an excellent idea of his art. These and the <cite>Horses at the Door of a
    Cottage</cite> (No. 2526) show that Paul Potter had a sound knowledge of
    animal anatomy. He is seen at his best in small compositions such as
    are here exhibited, in which the construction and <i lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i> are
    simple and the details delicately rendered. It is a popular fallacy
    that his chief contribution to the fame of Dutch art was his large
    <cite>Bull</cite> of 1647, which measures 8 ft. by 12 ft., in The Hague Gallery.
    He did not live long enough to form a “school.”</p>

  <h3 id="THE_ITALIAN_INFLUENCE">THE ITALIAN INFLUENCE</h3>

  <p>The Italianising influence was already beginning to make itself felt,
    to the lasting detriment of Dutch painting, and the typical example
    of this downward movement is Nicolaes Berchem (1620–1683), who was
    founded on his father, Pieter Claesz, and on Pieter de Grebber, and Jan
    Wils at Haarlem, while he also was impressed by Claes Moyaert and J.
    B. Weenix at Amsterdam, where he removed in 1677. There is scarcely a
    well-furnished gallery in Europe that does not seek to pride itself on
    possessing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> one of Berchem’s renderings of <cite>Crossing the Ford</cite>, or a
    <cite>Woman upon an Ass in conversation with another Person</cite>. The Louvre is
    no exception to this rule, and exhibits his <cite>Cattle crossing a Ford</cite>
    (No. 2315) and nine other canvases and panels, nearly all of which bear
    his much-vaunted signature. His art is to-day deservedly out of fashion
    with discerning collectors.</p>

  <p>Berchem’s pupil, Karel du Jardin (1622–1678), who is invariably at
    much pain to sign his pictures, is seen to some advantage in his very
    Italian and in every way characteristic <cite>Italian Charlatans</cite> (No.
    2427), the typical <cite>Ford in Italy</cite> (No. 2428), and eight other works.
    His attempts to depict a <cite>Calvary</cite> (No. 2426) have not been crowned
    with success, as the composition is overcrowded and undramatic; nor do
    we experience any emotion on regarding his <cite>Portrait of Himself</cite> (No.
    2434), a small production on copper.</p>

  <p>Breenberg (1599–1659?), who was born at Deventer, the home of Terborch,
    has depicted a <cite>View of the Campo Vaccino at Rome</cite> (No. 2334), and a
    <cite>Ruins of the Palace of the Cæsars</cite> (No. 2335) in the Italian manner
    beloved by Berchem and Pieter van Laer. The latter, who is also
    named Bamboccio, is represented by two small oval panels. Lingelbach
    (1622–1674), who frequently collaborated with other Dutch artists, may
    be judged by his <cite>Vegetable Market at Rome</cite> (No. 2447) and three other
    canvases, and Frédéric de Moucheron (1633?–1686) by a <cite>Leaving for the
    Hunt</cite> (No. 2482). It will be convenient to mention here Reynier Nooms,
    whose <cite>View of the Old Louvre from the Seine</cite> (No. 2491) has some
    historical interest.</p>

  <h3 id="ARCHITECTURAL_PAINTERS">ARCHITECTURAL PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>A limited number of painters busied themselves in making faithful
    transcripts of the streets and the exterior appearance of the
    buildings. Jan van der Heyden (1637–1712) was perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> most
    successful in this direction, and his <cite>View of the Town Hall of
    Amsterdam</cite> in 1688 is an excellent example of his methods, while
    the Louvre also possesses three small panels by him. Jan Abrahamsz
    Beerstraten (1622–1666), the son of a cooper at Amsterdam, travelled
    to Italy and the Mediterranean, proof of which is afforded by his <cite>Old
    Town Gate at Genoa</cite> (No. 2310). The typical architectural painter is,
    however, Gerrit Berckheyde (1638–1698). Although he never went to
    Italy, his <cite>View of Trajan’s Column</cite> (No. 2324) is a welcome relief
    from the many versions he painted, with conspicuous success, of <cite>The
    Market-Place of Haarlem</cite>.</p>

  <p>Hendrik van Steenwyck (1580–1648) almost invariably contented himself
    with reproducing the <cite>Interiors of Churches</cite> (Nos. 2582, 2583); but
    his <cite>Christ in the House of Martha and Mary</cite> (No. 2581) is an unusual
    subject with him, and must be his masterpiece. The <cite>Vestibule of a
    Palace</cite> (No. 2490), by Isaac van Nickelle (fl. 1660), is very good of
    its kind; but the <cite>Interior of a Guard-Room</cite> (No. 2453), by Aart van
    Maes, is a poor attempt at dramatic action.</p>

  <h3 id="MARINE_PAINTERS">MARINE PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>The fact that the Dutch had fought with swamp and water and possessed
    a large maritime commerce, is reflected in the <cite>Seascapes</cite> of Simon de
    Vlieger (1600–1660), and in the art of Ludolf Backhuysen (1631–1708),
    who is represented by a <cite>Stormy Sea</cite> (No. 2309) and five other
    canvases; but one of the best works of this class in the Louvre is
    the <cite>Marine-piece</cite> (No. 2600) by Willem van de Velde the Younger
    (1633–1707), who crossed over to England, and after a long career died
    at Greenwich. These men sought to carry on the earlier tradition of Jan
    van Goyen and the two Ruisdaels, but they showed less originality and
    power.</p>

    <h3 id="STILL_LIFE_PAINTERS">STILL-LIFE PAINTERS</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Much appreciation and some extravagant praise has been lavished on
    the still-life painters who, at the time when the higher aims of
    artistic endeavour began to die out in Holland, displayed remarkable
    ability. The cultivation of horticulture at Haarlem, the centre of the
    tulipomania fever in the middle of the seventeenth century, may have
    had an influence on the artistic presentation of inanimate nature;
    this feeling was no doubt stimulated by the display made by the
    goldsmiths in an age of great prosperity. Willem Claesz Heda, who was
    born 1594, is among the earliest of the Dutch still-life painters, and
    his picture (No. 2390) is dated 1637; he, however, did not die until
    more than forty years later. Jan Davidsz de Heem (1606–1684), the
    painter of <cite>Fruit and a Vase on a Table</cite> (No. 2391) and of another and
    much larger picture (No. 2392), was the pupil of his father, David de
    Heem; as he spent many years at Antwerp, he is sometimes regarded as
    a Flemish painter. That Abraham van Beyeren (1620–1675?), who painted
    several sea-pieces, was specially fond of copying the appearance of
    fish, is seen from his <cite>Still-life: Fish</cite> (No. 2326<span class="smcap">a</span>), at
    the Louvre, which has in recent years also acquired another work (No.
    2312<span class="smcap">a</span>) by him. Willem Kalf (1621?–1693) may have studied
    under H. G. Pot, the Haarlem genre-painter. He was evidently impressed
    with the chiaroscuro of Rembrandt, and often placed the drinking-cups,
    wine-glasses, and fruit on a richly-coloured tablecloth. He is here
    represented by four examples, of which the <cite>Dutch Interior</cite> (No. 2436)
    is the best. Eight pictures by Jan Huysum (1682–1749), two by Jan
    van Os (1744–1808), and one by C. van Spaendonck (1756–1839) belong
    to the latest phase of art in Holland, and mark the decadence in
    full operation. It will be noticed that the Louvre has a much larger
    selection of still-life pictures than the National Gallery, which seems
    to regard achievements of this kind with disdain.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

  <p>Melchior Hondecoeter (1636–1695), the painter of the farmyard, gives
    unmistakable proof of his power in his large signed <cite>Eagle swooping
    down on a Farmyard</cite> (No. 2405), and two rather smaller pictures (Nos.
    2406–7).</p>

  <p>Jan Weenix (1640–1719), who usually concerns himself with dead game
    and birds, is working on the usual lines in three (Nos. 2610, 2611,
    and 2612<span class="smcap">a</span>) of his four pictures in the great French museum;
    the other represents <cite>A Seaport</cite> (No. 2612). He was the fellow-pupil
    of Hondecoeter in the studio of his father, Jan Baptist Weenix
    (1621–1660), who studied for a time under the early Dutch master,
    Abraham Blomaert, and worked in Italy for four years. For that reason
    the latter has adopted an Italian mode of signing his only picture (No.
    2609) in the Louvre.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_DECLINE">THE DECLINE</h3>

  <p>Although Gerard Honthorst (“Gerard of the Night”) was born as early as
    1590, and was a pupil of Blomaert, he may he relegated to the period
    of decline. Almost invariably he resorted to the trick of lighting the
    figures in his pictures, whether he was painting religious subjects,
    portraits, or conversation-pieces, with a candlelight effect. This
    habit he had acquired in Italy by studying the style of Caravaggio. Of
    his five pictures here, the best is perhaps the <cite>Portrait of Charles
    Louis, Duke of Bavaria</cite> (No. 2410), of 1640. His <cite>Concert</cite> (No. 2409),
    painted sixteen years earlier, is an ill-balanced and overloaded
    composition.</p>

  <p>Such artists as Abraham Hondius, who paints a <cite>Man Selling Pigeons</cite>
    (No. 2407<span class="smcap">a</span>); Karel de Moor, who was a pupil of G. Dou, and
    gives us an insignificant <cite>Dutch Family</cite> (No. 2477); Eglon van der
    Neer, whose name is signed on a small panel, <cite>A Man Selling Pigeons</cite>
    (No. 2485); Egbert van Heemskerck, whose <cite>Interior</cite> (No. 2393) is in
    the La Caze collection; Jan Verkolie, whose <cite>Interior</cite> (No. 2602)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> has
    been engraved; H. van Limborch, whose <cite>Pleasures of the Golden Age</cite>
    (No. 2446) was in the collection of Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span>; Louis de Moni,
    the painter of a <cite>Family Scene</cite> (No. 2476); and Willem van Mieris, a
    replica of whose <cite>Soap Bubbles</cite> (No. 2473) is at The Hague,—all these
    mediocre painters are the despair of the critic, and afford merely
    momentary entertainment for the curious.</p>

  <p>It is apparent that by this period the art of Holland was marked
    by mechanical inventions, the surface of these eighteenth-century
    paintings being highly fused and metallic in appearance. The four
    panels of Adriaen van der Werff (1659–1722), which include an
    unpleasant <cite>Magdalene in the Desert</cite> (No. 2617) and a repulsive
    <cite>Dancing Nymph</cite> (No. 2619), are characteristic examples of his
    monotonous art. The <cite>Disembarkation of Cleopatra</cite> (No. 2441) and the
    <cite>Hercules between Vice and Virtue</cite> (No. 2443) of Gerard de Lairesse
    (1640–1711), have the enamel-like smoothness and meaningless expression
    of academic art, although they have their usefulness as museum pieces.</p>

  <p>It is a remarkable fact that the Louvre does not contain a single
    example of the revival of art in Holland in the third quarter of the
    nineteenth century. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_EARLY_FRENCH_SCHOOL">THE EARLY FRENCH SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE early phases of the French school of painting—perhaps it would
    be more correct to say of painting in France—present one of the most
    interesting problems to the student of art history. It was not really
    until the great Exhibition of French Primitives held in Paris in 1904
    that any serious attempts were made to construct a history of Early
    French painting; but the learned arguments that have been brought
    to bear upon the tangled question have so far failed to establish
    the existence of an important autochthonous school in the fifteenth
    century. It is true that contemporary records mention the names of a
    few painters who seem to have enjoyed great repute at the Courts at
    which they were employed, but it has been impossible to connect any
    notable extant pictures with their names; whilst those other “French”
    painters who have left tangible proofs of their activity are almost
    without exception of Flemish birth and training. Indeed, most of these
    early pictures show no characteristics that may be described as French,
    save the types of the faces, which would naturally be taken from the
    country where the artists worked.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of dealing with the Early French pictures at the Louvre
    is considerably increased by the uncertainty of their authorship,
    the attributions being in most cases tentative and much disputed.
    Throughout we feel the lack of a definite basis for comparative
    criticism—the absence of properly authenticated works by the very
    masters whose names have been recorded in contemporary documents. One
    of the earliest of these masters is Jean Malouel, a Fleming, whose
    real name was Malwaele, and who worked in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> service of the Dukes of
    Burgundy at Dijon, where he died in 1415. To him has been attributed,
    without sufficient proof, the tondo of <cite>The Dead Christ supported by
    the Eternal Father</cite> (No. 996) and mourned by the Virgin, St. John and Angels.</p>

  <p>Equally uncertain is the attribution of the <cite>Last Communion and
    Martyrdom of St. Denis, First Bishop of Paris</cite> (No. 995), on which are
    seen, against a gold background, in the centre, the Crucified Saviour
    and the Eternal Father surrounded by cherubs; on the left, Christ
    giving the Communion to the imprisoned bishop, with a praying angel
    in the foreground; and on the right, the Decollation of St. Denis and
    his two companions, St. Rusticus and St. Eleutherius. An attempt has
    been made to identify this interesting picture with one ordered by
    Jean-sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, from Jean Malouel, and finished after
    that master’s death by Henri Bellechose, another Flemish painter, born
    in Brabant, who worked at Dijon between 1415 and 1431.</p>

  <p><cite>The Entombment</cite> (No. 997) is the work of an unknown and presumably
    Flemish painter, who shows a certain affinity with the painter of the
    famous <cite>Parement d’autel de Narbonne</cite> (No. 1342 <i>bis</i>) of about 1374.
    This altar-front is supposed to be by Girard d’Orléans and his son
    Jean, under whose name both the <cite>Parement</cite> and the <cite>Entombment</cite> were
    shown at the Exhibition of French Primitives in 1904. But all these
    attributions are largely conjectural.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_MAITRE_DE_MOULINS">THE MAÎTRE DE MOULINS</h3>

  <p>Chauvinistic French critics have made much capital out of the important
    national school that is supposed to have flourished towards the end
    of the fifteenth century at Moulins, and especially of the mysterious
    “Maître de Moulins,” so called from a famous triptych at Moulins which
    cannot be proved to be the work of a French painter, and shows very
    marked Italian characteristics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> although the types of the faces are
    distinctly French. Italian painters had been working in France ever
    since Simone Martini (1285?–1344) was employed to decorate the Pope’s
    Palace at Avignon; and in the absence of definite documentary evidence
    it will always remain a difficult matter to decide whether certain
    pictures, Italian in style and French as regards the types, are the
    work of Italian masters painting in France, or of Frenchmen trained by
    Italians.</p>

  <p>To the Maître de Moulins have been loosely ascribed certain pictures
    in the Louvre collection, especially since attempts have been made, in
    the face of great improbability, to identify him with Jehan Perréal,
    or Jehan de Paris, one of the few painters of that period whose French
    nationality has been satisfactorily established. Perréal was born at
    Lyons, and became Court painter in Paris to Charles <span class="smcap">viii.</span> and
    Louis <span class="smcap">xii.</span> In this capacity he was sent to England at the
    time of the marriage of Louis <span class="smcap">xii.</span> with Princess Mary Tudor,
    to design the bride’s toilettes. If Perréal be the painter of <cite>The
    Virgin between Two Donors</cite> (No. 998<span class="smcap">d</span>, formerly No. 1048, and
    now labelled No. —48), which bears upon the pilasters of a balustrade
    the letters “I P,” he is certainly not identical with the Maître de
    Moulins to whom have been attributed the portraits of <cite>Pierre II.,
    Sire de Beaujeu, Son-in-Law of Louis XI.</cite> (No. 1004), and his wife,
    <cite>Anne of France, Duchess of Bourbon, Daughter of Louis XI.</cite> (No. 1005),
    which are apparently the wings of a triptych of which the centre panel
    has disappeared. They are utterly lacking in charm of colour and are
    anything but masterly in treatment. Both the personages are portrayed
    kneeling, the husband being presented by his Patron Saint and the wife
    by St. John the Evangelist. The <cite>Portrait of Pierre</cite> was bought in
    1842 by Louis Philippe for £20. The companion panel was presented to
    the Louvre in 1888 by M. Maciet. M. L. Dimier has rightly pointed out
    that there is no evidence whatever to prove these two pictures to have
    been painted by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> French master. <cite>The Virgin between Two Donors</cite> (No.
    998<span class="smcap">d</span>) has lately been tentatively attributed to the “Master of
    the Ursula Legend.”</p>

  <h3 id="THE_DE_SOMZEE_MAGDALEN">THE DE SOMZÉE “MAGDALEN”</h3>

  <p>To the Maître de Moulins has also been attributed the somewhat
    overrated <cite>Magdalen with a Female Donor</cite> (No. 1005<span class="smcap">a</span>), which
    was formerly in the de Somzée collection at Brussels, and was, some
    time after the Exhibition of French Primitives in 1904, bought from
    Messrs. T. Agnew &amp; Son for £5000. The supposed similarities that have
    been noticed between this picture and the Moulins triptych on the one
    hand, and Jehan Perréal’s authenticated design for the tomb of the
    Duke of Brittany at Rennes on the other hand, are not sufficiently
    convincing either to arrive at a definite conclusion as regards the
    authorship of this <cite>Magdalen</cite>, or to establish the identity of the
    Maître de Moulins with Jehan Perréal.</p>

  <p>Of an even more problematic nature are the <cite>Pietà</cite> (No. 998<span class="smcap">c</span>,
    formerly No. 998) and the <cite>Calvary</cite> (No. 998<span class="smcap">a</span>), of which it is
    only safe to affirm that both were painted in France, the background
    showing in the case of the former the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés,
    the Seine, the Louvre, and the Butte Montmartre; and in the latter
    an equally distinguishable view of the Seine, the Louvre, and other
    buildings. Both pictures appear to be the work of Flemish painters
    who were not entirely uninfluenced by Italian art. This <cite>Calvary</cite> is
    labelled “<cite>Retable du Parliament de Paris</cite>,” and was formerly in the
    Palais de Justice in Paris.</p>

  <p>We need not dwell at any length upon the school of Douai, which should
    be considered as a branch of the Flemish rather than a national French
    school. Jean Bellegambe (<i>c.</i> 1470–1535) is its chief representative,
    and presumably the author of the small wing of a triptych depicting the
    figure of <cite>St. Adrian</cite> (No. 13<span class="smcap">a</span>) which was formerly catalogued
    as being of the German school (No. 2739).</p>

  <div>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
    <h3 id="JEAN_FOUQUET">JEAN FOUQUET</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Of far greater importance is the school which flourished at Tours, for
    here at last we meet with clearly marked personalities whose names
    are definitely connected with extant works, even if the character
    of their art remains essentially Flemish. The best known artist of
    this group is Jean Fouquet (<i>c.</i> 1425–1480?), who was Painter to
    Charles <span class="smcap">vii.</span> and Louis <span class="smcap">xi.</span> and wrought the wonderful
    miniatures in the famous Book of Hours at Chantilly. He was distinctly
    more successful as an illuminator than as a painter, although his
    masterpiece, the Chevalier diptych (of which one wing is at the
    Antwerp and the other at the Berlin Museum), is a work of considerable
    merit. The Louvre owns an interesting painting from his brush—the
    portrait of the corpulent Chancellor of France, <cite>Guillaume Juvénal des
    Ursins, Baron de Trainel</cite> (No. 288). He is depicted in three-quarter
    profile to the right, dressed in a fur-edged red robe, with hands
    folded in prayer, before an open book on a cushion. The pilasters in
    the rich architectural setting terminate in two bears supporting the
    Chancellor’s coat of arms. This important picture was bought in 1835
    for the sum of £36. It was then attributed to Michael Wohlgemuth!</p>

  <p>Fouquet is known to have painted Charles <span class="smcap">vii.</span> in 1444; but
    the <cite>Portrait of Charles VII., King of France</cite> (No. 289), with the
    inscription along the top, “<span class="smcap">le très glorieux roy de france</span>,”
    and below, “<span class="smcap">charles septiesme de ce nom</span>,” cannot certainly be
    identified with the picture referred to in contemporary records. The
    Louvre picture was acquired in 1838 for £18.</p>

  <p>The name of Jean Fouquet has for a long time been connected with the
    admirable little portrait known as <cite>The Man with the Wineglass</cite> (No.
    1000, formerly No. 1000<span class="smcap">a</span>). It was shown as a work of Fouquet
    at the Exhibition of French Primitives; and the attribution is still
    maintained by many French critics, although in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> official Catalogue
    the picture is given to an Unknown French painter of the fifteenth
    century known as “The Master of 1456” from a dated picture in the
    Liechtenstein Gallery in Vienna. The whole style of the painting would,
    however, point to German origin, the only thing French about the
    picture being the type of the personage represented. It is interesting
    to note that this portrait, which was bought from a Paris dealer in
    1906 for £7600, was formerly in the collection of Count Wilczek in
    Vienna, and was bought by its former owner at Ulm. It is probably the
    work of a painter of the Swabian school.</p>

  <h3 id="NICOLAS_FROMENT">NICOLAS FROMENT</h3>

  <p>Nicolas Froment, the painter of the diptych <cite>King René and his Second
    Wife, Jeanne de Laval</cite> (No. 304<span class="smcap">a</span>), is frequently mentioned
    by those who have constituted themselves champions of a supposed
    important Early French national school. The few pictures with which
    he may be credited include the <cite>St. Siffrein</cite>, now in the Seminary at
    Avignon, the <cite>Raising of Lazarus</cite>, now in the Kaufmann collection at
    Berlin, and the <cite>Burning Bush</cite>, which includes the Portraits of King
    René and Jeanne de Laval, as the Donors who ordered the picture for
    the Cathedral at Aix, where it still is. But the Louvre diptych is an
    inferior work. Nothing is known about the dates of his birth and death.
    He flourished between 1460 and 1480, and was employed by good King
    René, who was himself a painter of some distinction, if contemporary
    chroniclers are to be believed. Froment died at Avignon, where he
    appears to have worked some considerable time, allowing his art to
    absorb those distinctly Italian tendencies which distinguished the
    productions of the Avignon school ever since Simone Martini had early
    in the fourteenth century worked in the Provençal city of the Popes.</p>

  <p>A very typical instance of this Avignon school, with its blending of
    Northern realism and the noble sense of style of the early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> Italians,
    is the <cite>Pietà</cite> (No. 1001<span class="smcap">b</span>). The group of the Virgin with the
    rigid body of Christ across her knees, St. John on the left and the
    Magdalen on the right, has a sculpturesque dignity and grandeur not to
    be found in the Northern art of that period. The Donor on the extreme
    left rather destroys the balance of the composition. The mourners and
    the landscape are silhouetted against a gold background. The picture
    was formerly in the Chartreuse of Villeneuve near Avignon, and was
    bought by the Société des Amis du Louvre for the great French national
    collection at the price of £4000. A well-known Spanish critic has
    claimed that this is one of the very rare works by the Spanish artist
    Bartolomé Bermejo.</p>

  <p>Of the same school, but vastly inferior in conception and execution, is
    the much restored <cite>Christ rising from the Tomb, with a Donor and St.
    Agricola</cite> (No. 1001<span class="smcap">c</span>). There are in Gallery X. (Salle Jean
    Fouquet) a few more anonymous fifteenth-century paintings, which need
    not here be discussed as they are of no real significance. </p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE mere fact that many of the drawings and paintings which are now
    with good reason believed to be the work of Jean or Jehan Clouet
    (called Jehannet) passed, at a time when art criticism followed methods
    less scientific than those which prevail at present, under the name
    of Holbein, should suffice to indicate that Clouet’s art belongs
    essentially to the Renaissance, and that the Primitive or Gothic period
    had come to a close when he arrived in France from the Netherlands,
    where he was born about 1475. He apparently worked first at Tours,
    where his presence in 1516 is testified by documentary evidence; and he
    went to Paris before 1529. Although he was never naturalised, he became
    Groom of the Chamber to François <span class="smcap">i.</span>, and enjoyed an enormous
    reputation for his skill in portraiture. He died in 1540 or 1541.</p>

  <h3 id="JEAN_CLOUETS_DRAWINGS">JEAN CLOUET’S DRAWINGS</h3>

  <p>Not a single drawing or painting that has come down to us from this
    period, which was remarkable for its enormous production in Court
    portraiture, bears the signature of Jehan Clouet; but as a number of
    the best portrait drawings in the famous Chantilly collection—notably
    that of the <cite>Preux de Marignan</cite>—are obviously from the same hand, and
    extend, as can be proved from the age of the personages portrayed, from
    1514 to 1540,—the very years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> when Jean Clouet is known to have worked
    in France,—it is quite reasonable to assume that artist to be the
    author of this group of drawings. Their superiority over all the other
    drawings of the period would account for the fame enjoyed by the elder
    Clouet among his contemporaries.</p>

  <p>On the strength of these drawings it has been possible to ascribe
    to Jean Clouet a few painted portraits which are obviously based
    on the drawings and show, apart from such differences as must
    necessarily result from the use of a different medium, the same
    characteristics—firm draughtsmanship, a sure delicate touch in the
    delineation of the features, and also a certain stiffness and hardness
    of contour which are never to be found in the otherwise very similar
    but always supple and masterly handling of Holbein. It is now known
    that practically all the painted portraits of the period were executed
    from the delicate drawings in black and red chalk, of which so vast a
    number have come down to our day. But the fact that the vast majority
    of these drawings served as models to different painters leaves the
    question of attribution in a state of uncertainty. The mere tracing
    back of a picture to some extant drawing of acknowledged authenticity
    cannot be taken as proof of their common origin.</p>

  <p>Two pictures at the Louvre are attributed to Jean Clouet. Both are
    portraits of <cite>François I., King of France</cite>, but only the smaller one
    (No. 127) appears to be from his hand. Clouet’s royal patron is here
    depicted in three-quarter profile to the right, at the age of about
    thirty, so that the picture may be assumed to have been painted about
    the year 1524. It is based on a drawing in the Chantilly collection.
    The larger <cite>Portrait of François I.</cite> (No. 126) has at various times
    been attributed to Jean Clouet, Mabuse, and Joost van Cleef, but is, as
    has been pointed out by M. Dimier, pronouncedly Italian in colour and
    in the treatment of the costume and hands.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of his life Jean Clouet was assisted in the execution
    of his numerous commissions by his brother Clouet de Navarre, to whom
    is attributed the <cite>Portrait of Louis de Saint-Gelais, Lord of Lansac,
    Captain of one of the “Compagnies des cent Gentilshommes” under Charles
    IX.</cite> (No. 134), and by his son François Clouet (1500?–1572). It has
    been stated that François Clouet, who was to become after his father’s
    death the favourite portrait painter of François <span class="smcap">i.</span>, Henri
    <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, Catherine de Médicis, François <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, and Charles
    <span class="smcap">ix.</span>, was born at Tours; but it is far more likely that he too
    was born in the Netherlands, and, while still young, accompanied his
    father to France. Practically nothing is known of his life before the
    year 1541, when François <span class="smcap">i.</span> renounced to Clouet his kingly
    right to the artist’s inheritance, which could have been claimed by the
    Crown as the estate of a foreigner. In the same year François Clouet
    was appointed Groom of the Chamber and Painter-in-Ordinary to the King.</p>

  <p>The Louvre is fortunate in possessing one of the exceedingly rare
    signed pictures by this artist in the <cite>Portrait of Pierre Quthe</cite>
    (No. 127<span class="smcap">a</span>), which was found in Vienna a few years ago by
    M. Moreau-Nélaton and presented to the Gallery by that active and
    patriotic institution, the Société des Amis du Louvre. Pierre Quthe
    was a notable burgher and apothecary of Paris, who owned one of the
    finest gardens in that city. He was an intimate friend and neighbour
    of François Clouet in the rue St. Avoye. In the Louvre painting, which

  <p class="noindent">he is depicted three-quarter-length life size, dressed in
    a doublet of black velvet with lace insertions, with a herbarium. The
    picture hangs at present on a screen in Gallery XV.</p>

  <p>Another unquestionably authentic work is the charming <cite>Portrait of
    Elizabeth of Austria, Wife of Charles IX.</cite> (No. 130), of which a
    preparatory study in chalk, dated 1571, is to be found in the Paris
    Print Cabinet. The face is drawn and modelled with rare delicacy, and
    every detail of the richly jewelled gold brocade costume is rendered
    with faultless and miniature-like precision.</p>

  <p>Yet another precious little picture from the same hand is the small
    three-quarter-length <cite>Portrait of Charles IX., King of France</cite> (No.
    128), which is a reduced replica of the signed life-size version in the
    Vienna Museum. Both pictures were originally in Vienna, whence they
    were removed by Napoleon in 1809, but only the larger picture was taken
    back to the Austrian capital in 1815.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Portrait of Claude de Beaune</cite> (No. 133<span class="smcap">a</span>) is possibly
    another, though not very important, work from the master’s own brush;
    but neither the <cite>Portrait of François de Lorraine, Duc de Guise</cite> (No.
    131), nor the <cite>Portrait of Henri II., King of France</cite> (No. 129), are
    of sufficient merit to justify their attribution to François Clouet;
    whilst the portraits of <cite>Charles IX.</cite> (No. 132) and <cite>Elizabeth of
    Austria</cite> (No. 133) are frankly admitted to be copies after originals by
    the master.</p>

  <h3 id="CORNEILLE_DE_LYON">CORNEILLE DE LYON</h3>

  <p>François Clouet’s chief rival in royal favour was another Netherlander
    domiciled in France, who, from the city in which he spent the years of
    his greatest activity, has become known as Corneille de Lyon. He was
    apparently the head of a busy workshop at Lyons, from which were turned
    out large numbers of thinly painted, daintily touched-in three-quarter
    profile heads,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> executed almost transparently on a light ground.
    although these portraits are now generally described under the generic
    name of Corneille de Lyon, only the best among them can be accepted as
    the master’s own handiwork. Room XI. at the Louvre contains several
    insignificant and badly repainted portraits of this type. They are of
    no importance, as they are only copies or studio productions. Corneille
    became naturalised in 1547, in which year he was appointed Painter to
    the King. He died about 1575.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_SCHOOL_OF_FONTAINEBLEAU">THE SCHOOL OF FONTAINEBLEAU</h3>

  <p>The death of Perréal and Bourdichon a few years after the accession
    of François <span class="smcap">i.</span> had left France without any artists of note,
    save the few foreign portrait painters employed by the Court. François
    <span class="smcap">i.</span>, an enthusiastic art lover, who had seen and admired the
    great Italian masters in their own country, spared no effort to attract
    the leading masters to France. We have seen that he actually succeeded
    in securing the services of the aged Leonardo da Vinci, and that for
    a brief span Andrea del Sarto worked at his Court. When, about 1530,
    that art-loving king turned his attention to the decoration of his
    palace at Fontainebleau, there was not a single painter of French
    nationality, or artist living in France, who could have been entrusted
    with so formidable a task, and François <span class="smcap">i.</span> was again forced
    to enlist the best Italian painters available for the purpose. Having
    first engaged Pellegrino and other third-rate artists, he succeeded,
    in 1531, in inducing the Florentine Rosso to undertake the execution
    and supervision of the decorative work at Fontainebleau; and in the
    following year the Bolognese Primaticcio entered his service. Both
    belong to the Italian eclectic schools, and only concern us here in so
    far as their example led to the founding of what has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> been called the
    “School of Fontainebleau,” which was really an offshoot of the Italian
    eclectic school.</p>

  <p>In the early years of Rosso’s and Primaticcio’s activity at
    Fontainebleau practically all the work was done by these two painters
    and their Italian assistants, whose band was joined by Niccolò dell’
    Abbate. It was only after the death of François <span class="smcap">i.</span> that
    the teaching of the Italian eclectics at Fontainebleau produced a
    generation of French artists capable of doing justice to the decorative
    tasks for which an ever-increasing demand had meanwhile arisen. That
    the Louvre is singularly poor in works by these painters may partly be
    accounted for by the comparative scarcity of easel pictures painted
    by artists who were chiefly employed for interior decoration. There
    is no reason for crediting any Frenchmen with the three anonymous
    school of Fontainebleau pictures in Gallery XI.: <cite>Diana</cite> (No. 1013),
    <cite>The Chastity of Scipio</cite> (No. 1014), and <cite>The Toilet of Venus</cite> (No.
    1014<span class="smcap">a</span>). <cite>The Chastity of Scipio</cite> in particular would appear to
    be the work of Niccolò dell’ Abbate.</p>

  <h3 id="JEAN_COUSIN">JEAN COUSIN</h3>

  <p>The most famous of all the French painters of the school is Jean
    Cousin, who from the <cite>Last Judgment</cite> (No. 155) at the Louvre—the only
    known painting from his brush that has been preserved—has been called
    “The French Michelangelo.” Nothing is known of his life, save that he
    was born at Soucy, near Sens, that he worked in Paris in the third
    quarter of the sixteenth century, and that he was still alive in 1583.
    Comparison of his picture with Michelangelo’s great work in the Sistine
    Chapel only helps to accentuate the absurd over-estimation to which
    he owes his sobriquet. He was merely a follower of Primaticcio, an
    excellent draughtsman with great knowledge of anatomy, but lacking in
    taste, imagination, and real power.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

  <p>Ambroise Dubois (1543–1614) was born at Antwerp, but is generally
    counted among the French painters of the school of Fontainebleau. He
    was entrusted by Henri <span class="smcap">iv.</span> with several important series
    of paintings for the decoration of the apartments at Fontainebleau,
    notably with eight scenes illustrating Tasso’s “<cite>Gerusalemme Liberata</cite>”
    for one of the Queen’s rooms, and fifteen scenes from “<cite>Theogenes and
    Chariclea</cite>” by Heliodorus for the “King’s Great Closet.” One from each
    series has found its way into the Louvre collection: <cite>The Baptism of
    Clorinda</cite> (No. 272), and <cite>Chariclea, undergoing the Ordeal of Fire, is
    recognised by her Parents, King Hydaspes and Queen Persina</cite> (No. 271).</p>

  <p>The only other painter of this group who is represented at the Louvre
    is Martin Fréminet (1567–1619), who was only indirectly connected with
    the school of Fontainebleau, as he had received his art education in
    Florence. His best known work is the ceiling of the Trinity Chapel at
    Fontainebleau. His picture at the Louvre represents <cite>Mercury ordering
    Æneas to leave Dido</cite> (No. 304).</p>

  <p>The decline of the school of Fontainebleau was so rapid and complete
    that, when Marie de Médicis decided to have the great gallery of the
    Luxembourg Palace decorated, in 1620, there was not a single painter
    left in France capable to undertake this important work, which was
    eventually entrusted to Rubens. But the whole direction to be taken
    by French seventeenth-century art had been determined by François
    <span class="smcap">i.</span>, and the influence of the Late Italians remained paramount
    until the dawn of the new era which was to be initiated by Watteau. </p>

    <h2 id="THE_SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY_FRENCH_SCHOOL">THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH SCHOOL</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THROUGHOUT the seventeenth century the impulse for the artistic
    activity of France emanated from Rome. But before discussing the
    dominating personalities of the age we must refer to a few painters who
    occupy a more or less isolated position in the art of their country.</p>

  <p>The naturalism of Caravaggio was introduced into France by two of
    his followers, Jean de Boulongne, called Le Valentin (1591–1634),
    and Simon Vouet (1590–1649), who was also slightly influenced by the
    Venetians. Valentin spent the best part of his life in Rome, where he
    died in 1634. The Louvre owns, among eight pictures from his brush
    (not all of which are exhibited), his masterpiece, <cite>The Innocence of
    Susannah recognised</cite> (No. 56), which has the vigorous handling and bold
    chiaroscuro of the Neapolitan school.</p>

  <p>Simon Vouet, who came to England at the age of fifteen, and
    subsequently travelled in Turkey and Italy, where he remained until
    his appointment as Painter to the King took him back to Paris in 1627,
    tried to combine the naturalism of Caravaggio with the colouring of the
    Venetians, an endeavour in which he was only partially successful, as
    he was not equipped by nature with a sensuous appreciation of beautiful
    colour. The Louvre owns a dozen Scriptural subjects and allegorical
    figures by Vouet; but even the best of them, <cite>The Presentation of Jesus
    in the Temple</cite> (No. 971), is but a dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> and heavy performance; whilst
    his <cite>Portrait of Louis XIII.</cite> (No. 976) is wholly devoid of artistic
    merit. Perhaps he owes his fame chiefly to the fact that he was the
    master of the absurdly overrated Le Sueur and of that art despot of the
    Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> era, Charles Le Brun.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_BROTHERS_LE_NAIN">THE BROTHERS LE NAIN</h3>

  <p>Of far greater artistic significance are the three brothers, Antoine,
    Louis, and Matthieu Le Nain, who were born at Laon, and flourished
    in Paris during the first half of the seventeenth century. Antoine
    and Louis died in 1648, and Matthieu in 1677. Very little is known of
    their history, but the splendid array of their works in Gallery XIII.
    proves them to have had close affinities with the contemporary Dutch
    and Flemish schools, even if their manner of composition suggests close
    acquaintance with Spanish art. Their subjects, too, like those of many
    of the Northern masters of their time, are taken from the daily life of
    the people, which is rendered with naïve honesty, and at times with a
    real appreciation of beautiful pigment. So far it has been impossible
    to distinguish between the works of the three brothers, as even the
    signatures “<span class="smcap">le nain</span>, <span class="small">fecit 1647</span>,” on
    the <cite>Portraits in an Interior</cite> (No. 543), and “<span class="smcap">le nain</span>,
    <span class="small">fecit anno 1642</span>,” on the <cite>Peasants at their Meal</cite>
    (No. 548, La Caze Gallery), afford no clue to the solution of the
    problem. The striking differences in brushwork and colouring, which
    are to be noticed in the eleven Le Nain pictures at the Louvre, would
    certainly suggest that the three brothers did not, or did only rarely,
    collaborate on the same pictures. The painter of <cite>The Return from
    Haymaking</cite> (No. 542), with its prophetic suggestion of the <i lang="fr">plein-air</i>
    effects of late nineteenth-century art, cannot have had much in common
    with the painter of the dull and dingy <cite>Denial of St. Peter</cite> (No. 547).</p>

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
    <h3 id="NICOLAS_POUSSIN">NICOLAS POUSSIN</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The founder of the Classicist school of French painting, which has
    had official approval and support from his time to the present day,
    was Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665). Born at Les Andelys in Normandy, he
    went to Paris at the age of eighteen, and became so fascinated by the
    examples of antique sculpture that, in spite of his extreme poverty,
    he determined to continue his studies in Rome. It is unnecessary here
    to relate the struggles that preceded his arrival at Rome in 1624.
    He frequented the school of Domenichino; but what was more decisive
    for the formation of his style was his unceasing study of antique
    sculpture, in which he was guided and encouraged by his friend, the
    sculptor Duquesnoy. After some years of continued poverty, he found
    at last liberal patronage, and rose to such fame that on his return
    to Paris in 1640 he was appointed Painter-in-Ordinary to the King.
    However, the duties and restrictions attached to this position proved
    so irksome to Poussin, that after two years he returned to Rome, where
    he spent the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>At the Louvre is to be found an imposing array of forty canvases by
    Poussin, whose art is as typical an expression of French genius as
    the poetry of Corneille. It is essentially intellectual, based on
    theoretical rules of design and composition, not in the least sensuous
    or emotional, but always coldly classical. The vast majority of his
    paintings at the Louvre are in such a deplorable state of deterioration
    and neglect that it is almost impossible to form an adequate idea
    of their original colour, but even the most ardent admirers of the
    master do not maintain that he was a great colourist. His pictures are
    entirely dependent on beauty of form and rhythmic design. They might
    almost be described as painted reliefs. This applies at least to his
    treatment of the human figure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> His conception of landscape, though
    still severely classical, is more pictorial and testifies to a genuine
    love of Nature—Nature idealised by a lofty imagination. To appreciate
    his greatness as a landscape painter, one has only to examine the
    glorious setting to his <cite>Orpheus and Eurydice</cite> (No. 740). The figures
    here are really of quite subordinate importance—mere incidents in a
    landscape painted with consummate mastery, perfect in linear and aerial
    perspective.</p>

  <p><cite>The Shepherds in Arcadia</cite> (No. 734, <a href="#i_plate37">Plate XXXVII.</a>) may be quoted to
    illustrate the calculated rhythm of his design and his indebtedness
    to classic art from which he derived his nobility of form. Real
    dramatic action was beyond Poussin’s range. His famous <cite>Rape of the
    Sabine Women</cite> (No. 724) is a striking instance of his failure to
    grasp the significant difference between dramatic movement and mere
    heroic posturing. Far more inspired, and therefore more natural and
    dramatically effective, is the superb circular painting for a ceiling
    commissioned by Cardinal Richelieu and representing <cite>Time rescuing
    Truth from the Attacks of Envy and Discord</cite> (No. 735). The allegory is
    said to have been intended as an allusion to the circumstances which
    induced Poussin to leave Paris for good. The design has more real
    vitality than is generally to be found in Poussin’s work; the action of
    the figures is more natural; and the colour music is not drowned by the
    prevalence of dingy browns. The decorative effect heralds in a strange
    way the art of the next century, and particularly that of Boucher.</p>

  <p>To see Poussin in the right perspective as regards the world’s great
    masters, one need only compare his two <cite>Bacchanals</cite> (Nos. 729 and
    730) with Titian’s rendering of a similar theme. The comparison is
    disastrous for the eclectic Frenchman. A <cite>Portrait of the Painter</cite> (No.
    743) from Poussin’s own brush is to be found in Room XIV., where no
    fewer than thirty-seven of his pictures are on view.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, the otherwise very complete collection of French
    pictures at the Louvre does not contain a single example of Poussin’s
    brother-in-law, Gaspard Dughet, better known as Gaspard Poussin
    (1613–1675), who devoted himself more exclusively to landscape than
    did his more illustrious relative. Nicolas Poussin’s influence also
    became decisive for the formation of the style of Claude Gellée,
    called Le Lorrain (1600–1682), who is represented at the Louvre by
    seventeen pictures (Nos. 310–326), most of which also have suffered
    considerably from discoloration and neglect. Claude, who was the child
    of poor parents, started life as a cook. In this capacity he went to
    Rome, where his talent for art was discovered by the landscape painter
    Agostino Tassi, to whom he served as cook and apprentice. Having
    learned all he could from his master, he returned to France in 1625,
    but, like Poussin, preferred to go back to Rome after two years spent
    in his native country. In the Papal city he lived the rest of his days,
    and rose to fame and affluence.</p>

  <p>He was essentially a landscape painter. The historical and legendary
    incidents introduced in such pictures as <cite>The Disembarkation of
    Cleopatra at Tarsis</cite> (No. 314), or <cite>Ulysses restoring Chryseis to her
    Father</cite> (No. 316), were to him a mere excuse for painting classic
    landscapes and imaginary buildings of noble proportion bathed in a
    golden atmosphere, which has hardly been rivalled by any contemporary
    or later painter. It is only on rare occasions, as in the <cite>View of
    the Campo Vaccino at Rome</cite> (No. 311), that he applied his gifts to
    the portrayal of nature. As a rule, his views are carefully arranged
    combinations of architectural and landscape elements brought together
    arbitrarily, and generally disposed in the manner of the wings and
    backcloth of a stage scene, but connected by the unity of light and
    atmosphere. Considering this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> method, it is amazing that his memory
    enabled him to invent such imaginary scenes with so great a degree
    of truth. <cite>The View of a Sea Port</cite> (No. 317, <a href="#i_plate38">Plate XXXVIII.</a>), in the
    subdued light of a misty day, is a magnificent instance of his masterly
    management of aerial perspective. It is signed and dated “<span class="smcap">claude
    <span class="small">in</span> roma, 1646</span>.” It is generally known
    how much Turner in his first manner owed to the example of Claude.
    That even Watteau was indebted to him may be gathered from such
    pictures as <cite>The Village Fête</cite> (No. 312), which, signed and dated,
    “<span class="smcap">claudio</span>, <span class="small">inv. Romæ</span>, 1639,” contains in germ
    the elements that constituted the greatness of the eighteenth-century
    master.</p>

  <h3 id="LE_SUEUR">LE SUEUR</h3>

  <p>Whilst Poussin and Claude were working in Rome, two pupils of Vouet
    reaped the highest honours in France. Eustache Le Sueur (1617–1655),
    whom his compatriots in their incomprehensible over-estimation of his
    mediocre gifts have called the “French Raphael,” certainly strove
    to emulate the divine Urbinate; but how badly he succeeded in this
    endeavour is to be gathered from the fifty-two paintings, by the
    placing of which his memory is retained at the Louvre. What dignity
    there is in the simple flow of line in his designs, is completely
    ruined by the offensive crudeness of his colour. Even allowing for the
    inevitable fluctuations of taste in matters of art, it is difficult
    now to understand how enthusiasm could ever have been aroused by the
    works that were considered his masterpieces, <cite>St. Paul preaching at
    Ephesus</cite> (No. 560), which at the beginning of last century was valued
    at £10,000 (!), and the twenty-two <cite>Scenes from the Life of St. Bruno</cite>
    (Nos. 564–585), painted between 1645 and 1648 for the small cloister
    of the Carthusians in Paris. This series, which is a severe tax on
    the patience of the conscientious visitor, fills the whole of Gallery
    XII., whilst other paintings connected with it intrude <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>into the
    adjoining room, which is consecrated to the brothers Le Nain.</p>

  <p>Before passing on to Vouet’s most famous pupil, Charles Le Brun,
    whose despotic power imposed upon French painting during the “<i lang="fr">grand
    siècle</i>” its pompous rhetorical character, mention should be made of
    Sébastien Bourdon (1616–1671), who, but for his prolonged sojourn in
    Rome, which fed his ambition to excel in the “grand style,” would
    have been one of the most remarkable artists of his century. This
    conclusion is, at least, justified by his precious little painting of
    a group of <cite>Beggars</cite> (No. 76), which is perhaps unrivalled in French
    seventeenth-century art for quality of paint and appreciation of
    tone values; and by his excellent <cite>Portrait of the Philosopher René
    Descartes</cite> (No. 78), who was also painted by Frans Hals (No. 2383). In
    his treatment of scriptural and historical subjects he does not rise
    above the dull level of his contemporaries.</p>

  <h3 id="CHARLES_LE_BRUN">CHARLES LE BRUN</h3>

  <p>Charles Le Brun (1619–1690) studied first under Vouet, but, attracted
    by Poussin’s stronger personality, followed that master to Rome in
    1642, and continued his studies under his guidance. When Le Brun
    returned to Paris four years later, his reputation was already firmly
    established. Patronised by Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>’s powerful minister,
    Colbert, he was placed at the head of the newly founded Academy of
    Painting, and of the Gobelins Manufactory, became First Painter to
    the King and “Prince” of the French Academy in Rome; and was, in
    fact, given absolute power in all matters concerning the fostering of
    the arts and art industries. This despotic power explains how it was
    possible that Le Brun, who notwithstanding his brilliant executive
    skill and extraordinary facility never rose above the level of
    mediocrity, could impose his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> uninspired personality upon every phase
    of French artistic activity of his time.</p>

  <p>His enormous canvases at the Louvre, which probably occupy more space
    than has been allotted to any other painter, vainly endeavour to
    conceal the lack of real emotion and of a central motif by theatrical
    gestures and overcrowding. His masterpiece at the Louvre is <cite>The Tent
    of Darius</cite> (No. 511), which represents the family of Darius imploring
    Alexander the Great for mercy. But even here one feels the absence of
    dramatic inspiration and concentration. Less successful are the other
    scenes from the history of Alexander: <cite>The Passage of the Granicus</cite>
    (No. 509), <cite>The Battle of Arbela</cite> (No. 510), <cite>Alexander and Porus</cite>
    (No. 512), <cite>Alexander entering Babylon</cite> (No. 513). The whole series
    was painted between 1661 and 1668 for execution in tapestry and was
    exhibited at the Salon in 1673, the year in which for the first time
    an official catalogue was compiled. Besides many scriptural and
    mythological subjects, and a few portraits from Le Bran’s brush, there
    are at the Louvre his decorative paintings on the ceiling of the
    Galerie d’Apollon in which the magnificent centre panel was added two
    centuries later by Delacroix.</p>

  <h3 id="PIERRE_MIGNARD">PIERRE MIGNARD</h3>

  <p>Le Bran’s successor in the direction of the Academy and the Gobelin
    works, Pierre Mignard (1612–1695), called “Le Romain” owing to his long
    domicile in Rome after the completion of his studies under Vouet, did
    not have his precursor’s large decorative faculty and sweeping ease of
    execution. Yet the excessively affected grace and the careful finish
    of his pictures, of which <cite>The Virgin of the Grapes</cite> (No. 628) is a
    thoroughly characteristic instance, helped to raise him to an exalted
    position in the opinion of his contemporaries. To this day the affected
    style of prettiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> of which he was the high priest is known as
    “<i lang="fr">mignardise</i>.” His power was altogether insufficient for the ambitious
    decorative tasks he set himself in emulation of Le Brun. If he has any
    claim to the esteem of posterity, it is for having left the world a
    portrait gallery of the notable men and women of his time—portraits
    which are by no means free from flattery and mannered grace, but
    constitute, nevertheless, a valuable historical record. Of these the
    Louvre owns the <cite>Portrait of the Artist at Work in his Studio</cite> (No.
    640); the <cite>Portrait of Françoise d’Aubigne, Marquise de Maintenon</cite> (No.
    639); and the life-size group of <cite>Louis of France, Son of Louis XIV.,
    his Wife, and their three Children</cite> (No. 638).</p>

  <p>Colbert and Le Brun had succeeded but too well in carrying out the
    powerful minister’s ambition to direct French art towards industrial
    and decorative aims, to train an army of capable producers, and to
    place the whole organisation on what may be called a business basis.
    The system was, however, not favourable for the growth of independent
    genius. With few exceptions, the whole generation of painters that
    grew up under Le Brun’s régime are of no significance to the history
    of art. There were among them many capable craftsmen, but they only
    repeated in a feebler way what Le Brun had done on a more imposing and
    dazzling scale. Whole dynasties of painters arose, like the Boulognes
    and the Coypels, who, under official patronage, filled acres of canvas
    with florid, theatrical renderings of scriptural subjects, and with the
    bombastic mock-heroics of classic history and mythology seen through
    baroque spectacles.</p>

  <h3 id="LE_BRUNS_FOLLOWERS">LE BRUN’S FOLLOWERS</h3>

  <p>It would be giving undue importance to these painters of the Louis
    <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> period if we were to go beyond a mere enumeration of
    their leaders and their chief works at the Louvre. None of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> them
    possessed any marked individuality; and most of them were linked
    together, not only by similar aims and ambitions, but also by family
    ties. Four members of the Coypel family rose to great eminence among
    their fellow-artists, and to important official positions. Noël
    Coypel (1628–1707), the painter of the four historical compositions,
    <cite>Solon defending his Laws before the Athenians</cite> (No. 157), <cite>Ptolomy
    Philadelphus giving the Jews their Freedom</cite> (No. 158), <cite>Trajan giving
    a Public Audience</cite> (No. 159), and the <cite>Foresight of Septimus Severus</cite>
    (No. 160), all of which were originally executed for the Council
    Chamber at Versailles; his sons Antoine Coypel (1661–1722), whose best
    known pictures at the Louvre are the <cite>Susannah and the Elders</cite> (No.
    169) and the <cite>Democritos</cite> (No. 174), which recalls Jordaens in its
    exuberant life, and Noël Nicolas Coypel (1692–1734), whose goddesses
    and nymphs already reflect the taste which dominated the eighteenth
    century; as well as Antoine’s son, Charles Antoine Coypel (1694–1752),
    whose uninspired art may best be studied in the <cite>Perseus delivering
    Andromeda</cite> (No. 180).</p>

  <p><cite>The Triumph of Bacchus</cite> (No. 447) and <cite>The Annunciation</cite> (No. 445),
    by Charles de La Fosse (1636–1716); <cite>Hercules fighting the Centaurs</cite>
    (No. 53), by Bon Boulogne (1649–1717); and <cite>The Marriage of St.
    Catherine</cite> (No. 55), by his brother Louis Boulogne (1654–1733), only
    serve to illustrate the mediocrity of their respective authors. The
    impersonality of Bon Boulogne’s art had at least the advantage that his
    teaching left free scope for personal expression to his many pupils.</p>

  <p>Even the still-life painting of the “<i lang="fr">grand siècle</i>,” which found its
    chief exponent in Jean Baptiste Monnoyer (1634–1699), partakes of the
    love of pomp and display that characterises this period. Gold and
    silver vases, precious stuffs and furniture generally accompany his
    flowers, which are painted without real appreciation of their natural
    beauty, and in purely local tints without a hint of the effect of each
    colour upon its surround<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>ings. The <cite>Flowers</cite> (No. 648), in the La Caze
    Gallery, may be mentioned as a typical example.</p>

  <h3 id="BATTLE_PAINTERS">BATTLE PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>The battle painter, Jacques Courtois (1621–1676), called Borgognone
    and Le Bourguignon, though born in France, was so completely under the
    spell of the art of Italy, the country where he spent almost his entire
    life, that he can scarcely be reckoned as belonging to the French
    school. His furious cavalry <i lang="fr">mêlées</i>, though entirely imaginative (as
    such confused encounters of horsemen piercing each other’s ranks have
    never taken place in actual warfare), are painted, like the <cite>Cavalry
    Fight</cite> (No. 151), with a touch as swift as it is sure and expressive,
    and full of exuberant vitality.</p>

  <p>Joseph Parrocel (1678–1704), who, during a prolonged visit to Rome had
    benefited by Borgognone’s teaching, could not, after his return to
    France in 1675, escape the current of thought which dominated his time,
    and introduced the stage-heroic note into his master’s sham realism.
    The glorification of his king is the purpose of such pictures as <cite>The
    Passage of the Rhine by Louis XIV.</cite> (No. 678). The chief interest is
    centred in the richly apparelled group on their prancing steeds in the
    foreground.</p>

  <h3 id="JEAN_JOUVENET">JEAN JOUVENET</h3>

  <p><cite>The Descent from the Cross</cite> (No. 437), by Jean Jouvenet (1644–1717),
    which has been honoured by a position among the masterpieces in the
    Salon Carré, is certainly one of the most estimable compositions
    produced in France during this active but uninspired century. Not only
    in the general disposition of the design, but also in the use of colour
    as a constructive element, Jouvenet here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> acknowledges his indebtedness
    to Rubens, although he could never rival the luminous glow of the great
    Fleming’s palette. Most of his other pictures suffer from dull heavy
    shadows and exaggerated expression. His strong and honest painting
    of the kneeling group in <cite>The Abbé Delaporte officiating at the High
    altar of Nôtre-Dame</cite> (No. 440), makes us regret that he did not devote
    himself more to subjects taken from the life of his time.</p>

  <p>An artist who was less tied to the tyranny of the official school, and
    imbued with a really profound sense of the beautiful, was Jean Baptiste
    Santerre (1658–1717). The delicate perfection of form of the nude in
    <cite>Susannah and the Elders</cite> (No. 835) approaches him to David and Ingres
    at their best. But this very perfection carries the germ of decay,
    because it is incapable of progress, and stagnation in art signifies
    death. As regards his technique, Santerre was extremely careful and
    conscientious. He reduced his palette to but five colours, and waited
    ten years after the completion of a picture before putting on the final
    coat of varnish.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_PORTRAIT_PAINTERS">THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>The two great portrait painters who flourished under the “Grand
    Monarque,” Rigaud and Largillière, were preceded by an artist to whom,
    perhaps owing to the relative scarceness of his works, history has
    done but scant justice. Whilst the Louvre contains thirteen portraits
    by Largillière and seventeen by Rigaud, only two pictures stand to the
    name of Claude Lefebvre (1632–1675); but his <cite>Portraits of a Master
    and his Pupil</cite> (No. 529) and the <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No. 530), are
    distinguished by a penetrating insight into character and an incisive
    vigour of style that form a striking contrast to the shallow bombast
    introduced even into portraiture by the fashionable painters to the
    Court. Lefebvre has been compared with Van Dyck. The <cite>Portrait of a
    Man</cite> (No. 530)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> has more in common with the brilliant audacity of Frans
    Hals’s brushwork. Lefebvre worked for some years in London, where he
    was a favourite at the Court of Charles <span class="smcap">ii.</span></p>

  <p>Rigaud’s manner of portraiture has none of these serious, manly
    qualities, but his skill in arranging the sumptuous accessories which
    play so important a part in his portraits,—as important, at least,
    as the actual features of the sitters,—secured him the patronage of
    the pomp-loving, haughty nobility. Hyacinthe Rigaud y Ros (1659–1743)
    was born at Perpignan and educated at Montpellier and Lyons. It was
    the advice of Le Brun that saved him from the customary pilgrimage to
    Rome and its inevitable consequences. It was Le Brun who recognised
    Rigaud’s bent for portraiture, and launched him on the brilliant
    career which gained for him the title of “the French Van Dyck.” Rigaud
    was enormously productive. Between 1681 and 1698 he is said to have
    painted six hundred and twenty-three portraits. And he had then another
    forty-five years before him!</p>

  <p>Rigaud’s best known picture at the Louvre is the stately <i lang="fr">portrait
    d’apparat</i> of <cite>King Louis XIV.</cite> (No. 781), a life-size full length,
    in which the spirit of the time, the curious blending of supercilious
    haughtiness, love of display, and affected grace of manner, are
    happily expressed in the monarch’s attitude and in the whole setting.
    The picture is signed and dated, “<span class="smcap">peint par hyacinthe rigaud,
    1701</span>.” The same tendencies are to be noted in the full length
    <cite>Portrait of Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux</cite> (No. 783), in which it is
    surprising that the prelate’s personality is not completely smothered
    by the splendid profusion of the accessories. His gifts appear,
    however, in a better light in his excellent <cite>Portraits of Marie
    Serre, the Artist’s Mother</cite> (No. 784), with the same head, honestly
    and soberly painted, twice on the same canvas, once in sharp profile
    looking to the right, and again, facing this, a three-quarter profile
    to the left. Wholly unexpected is the delicacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> and softness of one
    of his pictures in the La Caze Room: the <cite>Portrait of the Duke of
    Lesdiguières as a Child</cite> (No. 792). His solitary excursion into the
    domain of “grand art” at the Louvre is at the same time his last work:
    <cite>The Presentation in the Temple</cite> (No. 780), which in grouping and
    lighting owes much to the study of Rembrandt.</p>

  <p>Nicolas de Largillière (1656–1746) was born in Paris, but was taken
    when still an infant to Antwerp, where he became a pupil of Goebouw.
    From 1674 to 1680 he worked in London as an assistant of Sir Peter
    Lely, from whom he acquired the clever tricks and mannerisms in the
    painting of draperies and the textures of silks and velvets and other
    materials, which were to form so important a part of his artistic
    equipment. After Lely’s death Largillière went to Paris, where he not
    only shared with Rigaud the patronage of the Court as portrait painter,
    but secured many important commissions for historical paintings which,
    perhaps to the advantage of his fame, are now all but forgotten.
    Largillière was not without distinction as a brilliant and daring
    colourist. Nor was he incapable, on occasion, of seizing the subtleties
    of his sitters’ character. But his praiseworthy qualities are more than
    balanced by his unpleasant affectations and by the baroque squirminess
    of his line. This tendency carried him to such insufferable excesses as
    the conglomeration of lumpy bosses which does duty for a hand in his
    <cite>Portrait of M. Du Vaucel</cite> (No. 484), in the La Caze Room.</p>

  <p>His boastful skill in the management of the satins and velvets in the
    overrated portrait group of <cite>Largillière with his Wife and Daughter
    in a Garden</cite> (No. 491), cannot atone for the singularly unfortunate
    and clumsy composition, and for the self-conscious affectation of each
    individual pose. More satisfactory, in spite of the superabundance of
    accessories and outward pomp, which in this case is a fitting attribute
    to the character of the sitter, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> <cite>Portrait of Charles Le Brun,
    First Painter to King Louis XIV.</cite> (No. 482), who is depicted in a
    colossal wig, seated before an easel, and wearing a superbly painted
    red velvet cloak.</p>

  <h3 id="LANDSCAPE_PAINTERS2">LANDSCAPE PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>It almost goes without saying that landscape art, which, even in its
    most artificial and “classic” phase is inspired by the love and study
    of nature, was sadly neglected in so artificial an age. Among its
    leading exponents must be mentioned the two Patels, father and son, of
    whose life we have but scant knowledge, and whose pictures resemble one
    another’s so closely that it is often difficult to determine which is
    by Pierre Patel, the father (1620?–1676), and which by Pierre Antoine
    Patel, the son (1648–1708), especially as both adopted the signature,
    “<span class="smcap">p. patel</span>.” In the case of the older artist’s <cite>The Exposure of
    Moses on the Nile</cite> (No. 680), and <cite>Moses burying the Egyptian whom he
    had Slain</cite> (No. 681), and his son’s four landscapes representing the
    months, <cite>January</cite> (No. 684), <cite>April</cite> (No. 685), <cite>August</cite> (No. 686),
    and <cite>September</cite> (No. 687), all doubts are set aside by the dates which
    accompany the signature. Both artists were close followers of Claude
    Lorrain, although their precise technique suggests the influence of
    Adam Elsheimer.</p>

  <p>A truer perception of nature came to France from the North, whence,
    indeed, throughout the history of French painting vitality was infused
    into an art that was cramped by officially imposed canons of Italian
    perfection. As far back as the time of Le Brun, Félibien and Roger de
    Piles had begun in the field of literary polemics the long struggle
    between the <em>Poussinistes</em> and <em>Rubenistes</em>, the adherents of an art
    dominated by design and perfect drawing, against the partisans of
    colour as a vital element. During the whole seventeenth century the
    Poussinistes, who commanded all the official support, held the field,
    though the Netherlandish strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> was represented by some of the finest
    painters of that period, like the brothers Le Nain, C. Lefebvre,
    and Philippe de Champaigne. In the eighteenth century the Northern
    influence became supreme through Watteau and Chardin on the one hand,
    and on the other through Boucher and Fragonard, both of whom were
    powerfully influenced by the study of Rubens’s works.</p>

  <h3 id="DESPORTES">DESPORTES</h3>

  <p>In landscape the healthy opposition to the prevailing classic style
    appears first in the work of the Flemish battle painter Van der Meulen,
    whose backgrounds, sketched on the spot, show a fine feeling for
    aerial perspective and atmospheric effects. But his example apparently
    attracted no followers. Though not, strictly speaking, a landscape
    painter, François Desportes (1661–1743), who owed less to his early
    training under Nicasius, a third-rate Fleming, than to his habit of
    using his own eyes and studying nature direct, treated landscape with
    similar freedom in the backgrounds to his portraits and pictures of
    the chase. In his paintings of animals, dead or alive, limp bodies of
    hares and birds arranged as still-life with flowers and fruits, or in a
    very frenzy of movement in his hunting pieces, he endeavours to emulate
    Snyders, without quite rivalling the Flemish master. Of his twenty-five
    pictures at the Louvre, twenty-three (Nos. 225–248) belong to this
    genre, but not all of them are actually exhibited. The <cite>Portrait of a
    Huntsman</cite> (No. 224), and the <cite>Portrait of the Artist</cite> (No. 249) seated
    under a tree, holding a gun in his right, and caressing with his left
    hand a hound whose paw is resting on a pile of dead game, serve to
    prove that he knew how to manage portraiture with the same bold, frank
    spirit and summary breadth. He was particularly happy in rendering,
    without laboured detail, the varying textures of fur and plumage.</p>

  <p>Desportes’s only successful rival as a painter of animals and hunting
    scenes was Jean Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755). How closely his style
    resembled that of the elder painter is to be seen from his <cite>Wolf Hunt</cite>
    (No. 667), the <cite>Dog watching Dead Game</cite> (No. 668), and one or two
    similar pieces at the Louvre. Oudry was first taught by his father,
    and subsequently by Largillière, who encouraged him in the painting of
    still-life, and directed his study particularly to the observation of
    tone values and of the interchange of colour that takes place between
    objects in close proximity to each other. In 1734, Oudry was appointed
    Director of the Beauvais Tapestry Works, which took a new lease of life
    under his able management. It was he who supplied the designs for the
    <cite>Fables of La Fontaine</cite>, which figure so frequently in the tapestries
    woven at that great establishment. Perhaps his most interesting picture
    at the Louvre is the large landscape <cite>The Farm</cite> (No. 670), signed and
    dated 1750, one of the earliest examples in French art of a rustic
    scene painted for its own sake, without any attempt at ennobling the
    landscape by forcing it into a formal arrangement.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT is quite in accordance with the tendencies displayed by these
    masters, that towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning
    of the eighteenth century an increasing number of artists preferred
    to devote their talent to recording the life of their own days to
    the endless repetition of the “grand-manner” subjects which had
    occupied the energy of the preceding generations. Thus Jean Alexis
    Grimou (1678–1740), who was Swiss by birth and entirely self-trained,
    introduced into French art the drinking scenes beloved of the Flemish
    masters. From his painting of <cite>A Drinker</cite> (No. 385) and the two
    <cite>Portraits of Young Soldiers</cite> (Nos. 386 and 387), it may be seen how
    little he was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> sympathy with the official art of his time; this is
    scarcely to be wondered at, since, instead of undergoing the customary
    course of academic training, he had formed his style by copying the
    works of Rembrandt and other Northern masters.</p>

  <p>Pierre Subleyras (1699–1749) was not quite so emancipated. In his large
    religious compositions he still follows the affectations of the grand
    style. His chief work of this kind is the <cite>Mass of St. Basil</cite>, at Sta.
    Maria degli Angeli in Rome, of which No. 857 at the Louvre is a reduced
    version. Of far more artistic significance are his small genre pieces,
    in which he attains to a rich quality of pigment and a justice of
    tone-values unique in French painting of his period. Subleyras is said
    to have been of Spanish descent; and there are in his scenes from La
    Fontaine’s “Fables”—notably in <cite>The Hermit</cite> (No. 862)—clear indications
    of his intimate acquaintance with Spanish art. The best of all his
    pictures at the Louvre is <cite>The Falcon</cite> (No. 861), which, apart from its
    general quality of tone, contains some still-life passages worthy of
    the brush of Chardin.</p>

  <h3 id="RAOUX_AND_DE_TROY">RAOUX AND DE TROY</h3>

  <p>Just as Subleyras should be judged by his genre scenes rather than by
    his scriptural subjects, so Jean Raoux’s (1677–1734) real significance
    lies in the intimate note he introduced into his fancy portraits, and
    not in his moderately successful excursions into mythology, like the
    <cite>Telemachus relating his Adventures to Calypso</cite>, at the Louvre (No.
    764). The <cite>Young Woman reading a Letter</cite> (No. 765), in the La Caze
    Room, is perhaps the most charming of many similar pictures from his
    brush. In sentiment it belongs entirely to the amorous century of Louis
    <span class="smcap">xv.</span>, which was to produce a Fragonard and a Greuze. Raoux
    was one of the first French painters of contemporary life. Brought
    up in the old tradition, he was in his last years influenced by the
    personality of the great Watteau.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

  <p>If Raoux was the somewhat sentimental painter of bourgeois life, Jean
    François de Troy (1679–1752) played not infrequently the chronicler
    of the elegant life of the leisured classes. Unfortunately this
    interesting phase of his art is not represented at the Louvre, which,
    besides the three <cite>Portraits</cite> (Nos. 886–888) in the La Caze collection,
    contains two of his famous designs for tapestry, representing scenes
    from the <cite>History of Esther</cite> (Nos. 884–885); and his large historical
    painting, <cite>The First Chapter of the Order of the Holy Ghost, held by
    Henri IV. in 1595</cite> (No. 883).</p>

  <h3 id="WATTEAU">WATTEAU</h3>

  <p>The master who was to break definitely with the cold, majestic,
    uninspired art of the seventeenth century, and who in leading
    French painting into new paths reached the very limits of poetic
    expressiveness imposed by material means, was Antoine Watteau
    (1684–1721). Born at Valenciennes six years before that city became
    French through the peace of Nymwegen, Watteau, the son of a poor
    Flemish tiler, was French, as it were, by accident only. In his early
    years, when he studied in his native town under Gérin, a mediocre
    local painter, he must have had occasion to become closely acquainted
    with the paintings of the Flemish masters. On the death of Gérin, in
    1702, he went to Paris, where he became assistant to the scene-painter
    Métayer. Watteau suffered dire poverty, and completely undermined his
    health through privation before his talent attracted the attention of
    his next master, Claude Gillot, with whom he stayed until 1708, when he
    became assistant to Claude Audran, a decorative artist of great repute
    and Keeper of the Luxembourg collections. At the Luxembourg Palace he
    was enabled to study the masterpieces of Rubens, Titian, and Paolo
    Veronese, from which he benefited as much as from his work from nature
    in the Luxembourg gardens.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

  <p>It was perhaps fortunate that he failed in the competition for the
    Prix de Rome in 1709, and was dissuaded from going to Italy. He
    was received by the Academy in 1717, when he painted his “diploma
    picture.” <cite>The Embarkation for the Island of Cythera</cite> (No. 982, <a href="#i_plate34">Plate
    XXXIX.</a>), which may be considered an epitome of his art. Sketchy as
    it is, this picture, which he painted in seven days, exceeds in
    poetic charm and in the beauty of its entrancing sparkle of mellow
    tones the more highly finished later version in the German Emperor’s
    collection. It is the most striking instance of a purely imaginary
    scene of unworldly happiness, tinged with that peculiarly Watteauesque
    vague melancholy,—the consumptive’s <i lang="fr">maladie de l’infini</i> to which
    M. Mauclair has drawn attention,—represented with such absolute
    atmospheric truth as to make it appear an incomparably beautiful
    reality. Technically, this picture, like <cite>L’Indifférent</cite> (No. 984)
    and <cite>La Finette</cite> (No. 985) in the La Caze Room, embodies in germ
    the theories which in the second half of the next century were
    scientifically worked out by the French Impressionists.</p>

  <p>Some time in 1719 or 1720, Watteau was in England to consult a famous
    physician. But his illness took a turn for the worse, and he had to
    return to his native country. After six months spent in Paris, he went
    to live at Nogent-sur-Marne, where he died on July 18, 1721. Watteau’s
    influence upon eighteenth-century art was prodigious; but his work
    remained unapproached by any of his followers and imitators, who too
    often sacrificed artistic considerations to a desire to please the
    lascivious tastes of a corrupt, pleasure-loving society. The <cite>Faux Pas</cite>
    (No. 989) is one of the rare instances where Watteau allowed a certain
    suggestiveness to enter into his work; but even here “the smallness of
    the subject is swallowed up in the greatness of the painting.”</p>

  <p>It is a strange fact that but for the generosity of La Caze, <cite>The
    Embarkation</cite> would be the only example at the Louvre of the greatest
    master produced by France. The reason for this extraordinary neglect
    may be found in the scant esteem in which Watteau was held until
    his eclipsed fame was resuscitated by the de Goncourts. The superb
    life-size painting of <cite>Gilles</cite> (No. 983), one of ten pictures by or
    attributed to Watteau in the La Caze collection, was sold at public
    auction in 1826 for £26; whilst <cite>L’Indifférent</cite> and <cite>La Finette</cite>
    together realised the sum of £19 at the Marquis de Ménars’ sale! Of
    the eleven pictures in the La Caze collection that were originally
    attributed to Watteau, <cite>L’Escamoteur</cite> (No. 622<span class="smcap">a</span>, formerly
    No. 987) is now acknowledged to be by his imitator Philippe Mercier
    (1689–1760), who was born in Berlin of French parents, and spent the
    most productive years of his life in London, where he died in 1760.
    The still-life piece <cite>Dead Game</cite> (No. 993), officially assigned to
    Watteau, has rightly been doubted; but the aspersions thrown upon
    the authenticity of the delicious <cite>Pastoral</cite> (No. 992) do not seem
    sufficiently justified. The profound influence of Rubens upon Watteau’s
    art is nowhere more pronounced than in the sketch <cite>The Judgment of
    Paris</cite> (No. 988), and in the beautiful oval composition <cite>Jupiter and
    Antiope</cite> (No. 991), which has, however, also much in common with
    Titian. The superb nude figure symbolising <cite>Autumn</cite> (No. 990), and
    another <i lang="fr">fête galante</i>, entitled <cite>Gay Company in a Park</cite> (No. 986), are
    no less creditable to the master’s genius.</p>

  <h3 id="WATTEAUS_FOLLOWERS">WATTEAU’S FOLLOWERS</h3>

  <p>Although Watteau indicated the direction that French art was to follow
    in a century when it had to cater no longer for the state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>apartment but
    for the boudoir, he left no follower worthy to carry on his tradition.
    Nicolas Lancret (1690–1743), who had studied under Dulin and Gillot,
    based his style upon Watteau, whom he almost rivalled as a draughtsman.
    But he was an inferior colourist, and wholly lacking in poetic
    inspiration. One has only to compare his <cite>Actors of the Italian Comedy</cite>
    (No. 470) with Watteau’s <cite>Gilles</cite> (No. 983), or his <cite>Music Lesson</cite> (No.
    468) and <cite>Innocence</cite> (No. 469) with their prototypes created by that
    master, to realise the inferiority of these thin, vulgarised versions
    of Watteau subjects.</p>

  <p>Jean Baptiste Pater (1695–1736), who, like Watteau, was born at
    Valenciennes, became a pupil of his fellow-townsman in Paris, and
    benefited considerably by his guidance. Although inferior as a
    draughtsman to Lancret, whom he did not rival either in originality, he
    far surpassed him as a colourist. With Lancret, colour was generally
    an afterthought; with Pater, it entered into the primary conception
    of the picture. His Academy diploma piece, the <cite>Fête Champêtre</cite> (No.
    689), is painted in the Watteau manner with true pictorial feeling,
    even if it lacks the master’s precious, jewel-like quality of pigment.
    The <cite>Fête Champêtre</cite> (No. 203), by Bonaventure Debar (1700–1729), holds
    promise of a considerable talent in a similar direction, cut short by a
    premature death.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_VAN_LOO_FAMILY">THE VAN LOO FAMILY</h3>

  <p>No fewer than five members of the Flemish Van Loo family, which
    flourished in France from about 1660 until the death of Julius Cæsar
    Van Loo in 1821, are represented in the Louvre collection. The most
    distinguished among them were Louis Van Loo’s sons, Jean-Baptiste
    and Charles André, better known as Carle. Both of them were brought
    up in the academic tradition; but their Flemish blood and the taste
    of a time that had seen the master-work of Watteau, gave their art
    more vigour and sensuousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> than is to be found in the paintings
    of their academic precursors. Still it is unnecessary to linger over
    their historical and mythological compositions. The picture which does
    most credit to Carle Van Loo (1705–1765) is <cite>The Hunt Picnic</cite> (No.
    899), which, in spite of a certain crudeness of colour, attracts by
    the science of the composition, the Watteau feeling of the landscape
    background, and by its fascinating reality as a record of contemporary
    life among the leisured, pleasure-loving classes.</p>

  <p>François Le Moine (1688–1737) constitutes a link between the decorative
    style of the preceding generation, which had become dull and ponderous,
    and the art of Watteau and his followers. In this position he heralds
    his great pupil François Boucher, whose characteristics, deprived of
    his elegant grace and suave rhythm of design, are more than hinted
    at in the <cite>Juno, Iris and Flora</cite> (No. 536). The <cite>Olympus</cite> (No. 535),
    the sketch for a ceiling, recalls in its joyful decorative colour and
    bravura of brush work the art of Tiepolo and Ricci.</p>

  <h3 id="FRANCOIS_BOUCHER">FRANÇOIS BOUCHER</h3>

  <p>Whilst such painters as Jean Restout (1692–1768) still continued
    to follow the tradition of the Bolognese eclectics, as may be seen
    in his <cite>Herminia and the Shepherd</cite> (No. 775), the art of the Louis
    <span class="smcap">xv.</span> period was given its final stamp by François Boucher
    (1703–1770). This favourite of Mme. de Pompadour, having gained the
    Prix de Rome in 1723, went to Italy in 1727, whence he returned to
    Paris four years later. At the age of thirty his <cite>Rinaldo and Armida</cite>
    (No. 38<span class="smcap">a</span>) caused him to be “received” by the Academy—the
    first of many honours that fell to his share, as he became in turn
    First Painter to the King, Director of the Academy, and Inspector of
    the Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory. He was the ideal painter of the
    age that was dominated by the personality of the Pompadour, who kept
    him employed with commissions for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> decoration of her boudoir.
    Boucher was the true child of his time—licentious, pleasure-loving,
    light-hearted, and without moral scruples. The astonishing thing is
    that his pursuit of pleasure did not affect his enormous productivity.
    His art is in perfect harmony with his character—frankly sensual,
    exuberant, and unreliable; at times rising to superb decorative
    splendour of the airy, graceful type demanded by his patrons, and then
    again careless to the point of slovenliness.</p>

  <p>Boucher was not a great colourist in the sense in which this term is
    applied to masters like Titian or Rubens. Indeed, more often than
    not his application of purely local colours unaffected by their
    surroundings is apt to result in the crudeness noticeable in his
    <cite>Pastoral</cite> (No. 33), and in the domestic scene called <cite>The Breakfast</cite>
    (No. 50<span class="smcap">a</span>). Other pictures like the <cite>Pastoral</cite> (No. 34) owe
    their present tapestry-like mellowness to the fading of the pigments.
    But it would be unfair to disregard the artist’s intention and to judge
    his capacity as a colourist from the present appearance of his works at
    the Louvre or in their usual environment in a public gallery. They were
    intended for definite decorative purposes, and in their proper Louis
    <span class="smcap">xv.</span> setting fulfilled their function in admirable fashion. Few
    artists excelled Boucher in rhythmic harmony of composition, although
    it must be confessed that his emphatic insistence on triangular design
    is apt to become monotonous. This predilection is to be noted in the
    <cite>Rinaldo and Armida</cite> (No. 38<span class="smcap">a</span>), <cite>Venus disarming Cupid</cite> (No.
    44), <cite>The Rape of Europa</cite> (No. 39), the <cite>Pastorals</cite> (Nos. 33, 34,
    and 35), <cite>Vulcan presenting Arms to Venus</cite> (No. 36, <a href="#i_plate40">Plate XL.</a>), and,
    indeed, in the vast majority of his twenty-two exhibited pictures at
    the Louvre. His mastery in flesh painting is best illustrated by the
    more unconventionally designed <cite>Diana leaving the Bath</cite> (No. 30), and
    the brilliant sketch of <cite>The Three Graces</cite> (No. 47) in the La Caze
    Room. Among his other masterpieces at the Louvre, <cite>Venus demanding
    Arms from Vulcan</cite> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>(No. 31), which like No. 36 was designed for
    execution in tapestry, and the charming <cite>Portrait of a Young Woman</cite>
    (No. 50), deserve special attention. It is unfortunate that they are
    not hung in the rooms that contain the magnificent furniture of the
    period, instead of being piled sky-high among pictures that seem to
    be primarily regarded by the officials as mere museum specimens of
    the art of painting. Boucher is better hung, and so may be much more
    effectively studied in the Wallace collection in London.</p>

  <h3 id="SIMEON_CHARDIN">SIMÉON CHARDIN</h3>

  <p>If Boucher and the army of painters of <i lang="fr">fêtes galantes</i> and boudoir
    decorations reflect the tastes of the corrupt society of Louis
    <span class="smcap">xv.</span>’s age, Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin (1699–1779) is
    the painter <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of the lower bourgeoisie. His was an
    uneventful, colourless life of unremitting work after the completion
    of his studies under Cazes and N. N. Coypel. He never went to Rome; he
    never sought after distinction in the “grand manner”; he never hankered
    after Court patronage. He simply devoted himself to recording with the
    utmost technical perfection the peaceful and domestic life of the lower
    middle class, to which he himself belonged, with all his tastes and
    habits of life, and to the painting of still-life, in which branch of
    art he stands without a rival. There are among his thirty-two pictures
    at the Louvre twenty paintings of <cite>Still-life</cite> (Nos. 89, 90, 94, 95,
    96, 98, 100, 105–116, and the doubtful No. 118), all equally remarkable
    for their inimitable skill in the rendering of the most varied textures
    and reflections; for subtle observation of the mutual effect of
    coloured objects upon each other through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> the interchange of coloured
    rays; and, above all, for that “sense of intimacy, of life behind the
    scene,” with which he knew how to invest even inanimate objects.</p>

  <p>This same sense of intimacy and of absolute pictorial unity is also
    the great merit of his domestic genre pieces, into which enters, in
    addition, the element of spiritual unity, of the absorption of each
    person in his or her occupation. In the deservedly famous <cite>Grace before
    Meat</cite>, at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, of which the Louvre owns
    two admirable replicas (No. 92, <a href="#i_plate41">Plate XLI.</a>, and No. 93), the most
    casual observer cannot fail to notice that intimate bond between the
    mother and the two children, which gives the impression of a scene
    accidentally overlooked, without anybody being aware of the intruder’s
    presence. <cite>La Mère laborieuse</cite> (No. 91), <cite>La Pourvoyeuse</cite> (No. 99),
    and even the cat in the still-life piece <cite>The Cat in the Larder</cite> (No.
    89), are equally innocent of “posing,” and absorbed in their respective
    occupations. <cite>The Boy with the Top</cite> (No. 90<span class="smcap">a</span>) and the <cite>Young
    Man with the Violin</cite> (No. 90<span class="smcap">b</span>), under which titles we have
    the portraits of the two children of the jeweller Charles Godefroy,
    were bought by the Louvre in 1907 for £14,000. These two pictures and
    the <cite>Castle of Cards</cite> (No. 103) are sufficient to establish Chardin’s
    supremacy in child portraiture.</p>

  <h3 id="FRAGONARD">FRAGONARD</h3>

  <p>Chardin for but a few months, and Boucher for two years, were the
    masters who taught Jean Honoré Fragonard (1732–1806) before, having
    gained the Prix de Rome in 1752 and worked three years under Van Loo,
    he set out for Rome, where under Natoire’s guidance he applied himself
    to the copying of old masters. More important for the formation of his
    style were the sketches he made in the company of his friend Hubert
    Robert in the romantic gardens of the Villa d’Este, and the deep
    impression created upon his mind by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>Tiepolo’s decorative paintings
    in Venice, which city he visited before his return to Paris in 1761.
    He scored his first great success in 1765 with the large and still
    somewhat academic composition <cite>Coresus and Calirrhoë</cite> (No. 290), which
    was bought by Louis <span class="smcap">xv.</span> for 24,000 livres for reproduction at
    his tapestry works.</p>

  <p>Patronised by Mme. du Barry, the dancer Marie Guimard, and other
    priestesses of Venus, Fragonard now devoted his exceptionally facile
    and spontaneous talent to subjects that in licentious frivolity,
    voluptuousness, and suggestiveness had never been equalled even by his
    master Boucher. It is only his marvellous technique, ranging from the
    liquid transparency of his swift oil sketches to the rich luminous
    impasto of the <cite>Sleeping Bacchante</cite> (No. 294); from the elegant
    arabesque of the <cite>Bathing Women</cite> (No. 293), so full of <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>
    and youthful fire, to the almost brutal strength of the portrait of
    a writer or poet, known under the title of <cite>Inspiration</cite> (No. 298).
    But in all these, as well as in the charming <cite>Music Lesson</cite> (No. 291,
    <a href="#i_plate42">Plate XLII.</a>), <cite>The Student</cite> (No. 297) and the <cite>Young Woman</cite> (No. 300),
    Fragonard proves himself one of the greatest colourists produced by
    the French School. It was Fragonard’s sad fate to outlive his fame, to
    witness the collapse of the ancient régime and the triumph of his pupil
    David’s classicism, and to die in obscurity and neglect.</p>

  <h3 id="GREUZE">GREUZE</h3>

  <p>Twenty-three paintings represent at the Louvre the art of Jean-Baptiste
    Greuze (1725–1805), who trod the safe path of flattering the taste of
    the multitude by the mawkish sentimentality of his genre-pieces and the
    prettiness and half-concealed sensuality of his “fancy portraits” of
    young women, which in their suggestiveness are perhaps more insidious
    than the frank improprieties of Boucher and Fragonard. The sentimental
    and melodramatic side of Greuze’s art is strikingly revealed in <cite>The
    Village Engagement</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> (No. 369), in <cite>The Paternal Curse</cite> (No. 370), and
    in <cite>The Punished Son</cite> (No. 371), which aroused the enthusiasm of that
    singularly misguided critic Diderot. But it is the painting of pictures
    like <cite>The Broken Pitcher</cite> (No. 372, <a href="#i_plate43">Plate XLIII.</a>), <cite>The Milkmaid</cite> (No.
    372<span class="smcap">a</span>), and <cite>The Dead Bird</cite> (No. 372<span class="smcap">c</span>; a replica
    of the picture in the Scottish National Gallery), that has made him
    the idol of a certain undiscriminating section of the public, and
    established him among the world’s most popular painters.</p>

  <h3 id="PORTRAIT_PAINTERS">PORTRAIT PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>The leading position among the portrait painters of Louis
    <span class="smcap">xv.</span>’s corrupt Court was occupied by Jean Marc Nattier
    (1685–1766), who was a good colourist, but was utterly lacking in
    sincerity, and placed his able brush at the service of the basest
    flattery. He has left a whole gallery of Court beauties posing as,
    and invested with the attributes of, Greek goddesses and allegorical
    personifications in the manner of the group of <cite>Mdlle. de Lambesc
    and the Comte de Brienne</cite> (No. 659) as Minerva preparing the hero
    for warlike exploits. The <cite>Magdalen</cite> (No. 657) is probably another
    contemporary portrait in fancy costume. His best picture at the Louvre
    is the <cite>Portrait of a Young Woman</cite> (No. 661<span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

  <p>François Hubert Drouais (1725–1775), the painter of the group of the
    <cite>Comte d’Artois (afterwards Charles X.) and Madame Clotilde, afterwards
    Queen of Sardinia</cite> (No. 266), who received a good share of Court
    patronage, showed considerable ability when he had sufficient strength
    to resist the temptation to flatter his sitters. But unfortunately he
    too often followed the example of Nattier in this respect.</p>

  <h3 id="TOCQUE_VESTIER_AND_LEPICIE">TOCQUÉ, VESTIER, AND LÉPICIÉ</h3>

  <p>A portrait painter of a very different stamp was Nattier’s son-in-law,
    Louis Tocqué (1696–1772). Although he, too, was a favourite <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>not
    only at the French, but also at the Russian and Danish Courts, the
    examples of his art at the Louvre suggest that he was but indifferently
    successful—from the artistic point of view—with his “official”
    portraits, like the <i lang="fr">portrait d’apparat</i> of <cite>Marie Leczinska, Queen of
    Louis XV.</cite> (No. 867), or the affected <cite>Portrait of the Dauphin Louis at
    the age of ten</cite> (No. 868). On the other hand, when he was not weighed
    down by the importance of his task, he attained to a solidity of style,
    strength of character painting, and beauty of technique that place
    him at the head of the French portraitists of his period. Tocqué was
    apparently never in England, but such masterpieces from his brush as
    the <cite>Mme. Danger embroidering</cite> (No. 868<span class="smcap">a</span>), and the supposed
    portrait of <cite>Mme. de Graffigny</cite> (No. 869), show distinct affinity with
    Allan Ramsay and Hogarth, with superadded French <i lang="fr">finesse</i> and suavity.</p>

  <p>In the case of Antoine Vestier (1740–1824) the pronounced leaning

    (No. 961), in the La Caze Room, might on superficial inspection pass
    for a work of Francis Cotes. Even in the <cite>Portrait of the Painter’s

    curiously English flavour.</p>

  <p>Honesty of purpose and serious concern with artistic problems mark the

    himself more particularly to the domestic genre, which he treated
    without the sentimentality and theatricality of a Greuze. Indeed, if
    there is any contemporary painter with whom he shows affinity, it is
    Siméon Chardin. That he was a landscape painter of no mean ability
    may be gathered from his <cite>Farmyard</cite> (No. 549), which, in spite of the
    predominating brown, is remarkable for its luminous transparency.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Before turning to the landscape painters Joseph Vernet and Hubert
    Robert, we must close the chapter of eighteenth-century portraiture
    with Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (1755–1842), since her art,
    although her life extended far into the nineteenth century, belongs
    essentially to the degenerate days of the <i lang="fr">ancien régime</i>—an art not
    devoid of grace, but exceeding in shallowness and insipidity the
    shallowest and most insipid productions of pre-Davidian days. Of the
    many masters from whom Vigée, herself the daughter of a painter,
    received advice, Greuze appears to be the one with whom she was
    most in sympathy. Married at an early age to Le Brun, a painter and
    picture-dealer from whom she was divorced after many years of wretched
    conjugal life, her career, of which she has left a full account in
    her autobiography, was one of adventure and truly extraordinary
    professional success.</p>

  <p>She was the favourite painter of Marie Antoinette, had to leave Paris
    during the Terror, and made an almost triumphal progress from Court
    to Court before she definitely settled in Paris in 1809. At Naples,
    Vienna, Dresden, St. Petersburg, Berlin, London, and other centres,
    Royalty and the world of fashion crowded to her studio; and her art
    even gained the unstinted approval of a judge like Sir Joshua Reynolds,
    which is the more surprising as Vigée Le Brun’s colour was almost
    invariably cold and unsympathetic. Her personal charms may have been
    partly responsible for her universal success, if reliance is to be
    placed on the questionable honesty of her flattering brush from which
    the Louvre owns two <cite>Portraits of the Artist and her Daughter</cite> (No. 521
    and No. 522, <a href="#i_plate44">Plate XLIV.</a>). Among her other pictures in the Louvre are
    the <cite>Peace bringing Abundance</cite> (No. 520), her reception piece at the
    Academy, and a portrait of her early friend and master, <cite>Joseph Vernet</cite>
    (No. 525).</p>

  <p>One has to realise that the art of landscape painting had become almost
    extinct in France, and that the art of seascape had never existed, if
    one wishes to account for Diderot’s enthusiasm with regard to Claude
    Joseph Vernet (1714–1789), which made him exclaim, “What pictures! He
    rivals the Creator in celerity, Nature in truth!” Our cooler judgment
    cannot so easily pass over all that is cold and formal in his art.
    But, taken in relation to his contemporaries, he deserves respect for
    his emotional attitude towards nature, for a sense of the dramatic
    that approaches Salvator Rosa’s, and for his admirable drawing of the
    figures introduced into his landscapes. Vernet’s love of the sea awoke
    when at the age of eighteen he journeyed to Rome, where he became
    imbued with the classic tradition. He only returned to Paris in 1752,
    and soon afterwards received from Louis <span class="smcap">xv.</span> the commission to
    paint the large series of <cite>French Seaports</cite> (Nos. 940–954) which are
    now to be seen in the rooms in this collection given up to the Musée
    de Marine. In his other marines and landscapes (Nos. 912–939), not
    all of which are actually exhibited, he allowed his imagination freer
    play than in the <cite>Seaports</cite>, which were naturally of more topographic
    character.</p>

  <p>Both his son Carle Vernet (1758–1836), a historical painter who
    excelled in the rendering of horses in movement, and his grandson
    Horace Vernet (1789–1863), a popular battle painter, are represented at
    the Louvre, the former by the <cite>Stag Hunt in the Forest of Meudon</cite> (No.
    955), and the latter by the <cite>Barrière de Clichy (Defence of Paris in
    1814)</cite> (No. 956), and the uninspired <cite>Judith and Holofernes</cite> (No. 957).</p>

  <h3 id="HUBERT_ROBERT">HUBERT ROBERT</h3>

  <p>Hubert Robert (1733–1808), of whose classic landscapes the collection
    contains nineteen examples (Nos. 797–815), was not, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> might be
    imagined from the general character of his paintings, influenced by the
    art of Claude Lorrain, but derived his love of antique buildings and
    landscapes peopled with classic figures from the general atmosphere of
    archæological enthusiasm engendered by the excavations on the site of
    Herculaneum, which prevailed in Rome when the young artist arrived at
    that Mecca of his profession in 1754. Robert lived and worked in Italy
    for twelve years, and became thoroughly imbued with this antiquarian
    spirit. Unlike Claude, he rarely, if ever, drew upon his imagination
    for the details of his classic landscapes, which are faithful
    transcripts of existing ruined or half-ruined buildings, though not
    infrequently they are arranged for greater pictorial effect. Of this
    half-realistic, half-classic nature—the introduction of people in
    classic garb among the ruins of buildings, which in classic times wore
    a very different aspect, is a pardonable anachronism—are the <cite>Interior
    of the Temple of Diana at Nimes</cite> (No. 799), and several similar pieces
    at the Louvre. In his smaller pictures, of which the best are the
    <cite>Fountain under a Portico</cite> (No. 812) and the <cite>Winding Staircase, with
    three Figures</cite> (No. 813), in the La Caze Room, he rivals the rich
    quality of pigment and mellow tone of Guardi at his best. Robert was
    Fragonard’s constant companion in Rome, and exercised considerable
    influence upon his friend, as may be seen from Fragonard’s landscape
    drawings.</p>

  <p>There is scarcely a trace of Italian classicism in the superb <cite>View
    in the Neighbourhood of Paris</cite> (No. 650), by Louis Gabriel Moreau
    (1740–1806), which in its silvery-grey tonality, in its sense of
    atmosphere, and in the treatment of the receding distances, rather
    recalls the manner of the Dutchman Philips de Koninck. That Moreau, who
    also worked in England, was not always free from conventionality, is
    proved by the rather formal composition of the <cite>View of the Hills of
    Meudon from Saint-Cloud</cite> (No. 651).</p>

  </div>

  <p>The boudoir art of the <i lang="fr">ancien régime</i> came to a natural end through
    the great social upheaval of the Revolution, of which Jacques Louis
    David (1748–1825) is the very personification in the realm of painting.
    As a pupil of Boucher, David in his early years was essentially a child
    of the eighteenth century. That he became the founder and head of a new
    classicist school, as tyrannical in his sway as had been Le Brun during
    the reign of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>, was due to the teaching of Joseph
    Marie Vien, whom he accompanied to Rome in 1775, the year in which
    Vien was appointed Director of the École de Rome. Vien was an eclectic
    and a purist of greater ability than would appear from his two dull
    pictures at the Louvre, <cite>St. Germain and St. Vincent</cite> (No. 964) and
    <cite>The Sleeping Hermit</cite> (No. 965).</p>

  <p>David’s participation in the events of the year 1789 and his ardent
    republicanism did not, as has often been stated, attract him to
    subjects from Republican Roman history. Indeed, he had already painted
    <cite>The Oath of the Horatii</cite> (No. 189) and <cite>The Lictors taking to Brutus
    the Corpse of his Sons</cite> (No 191), for Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span>, and was only
    following the current of taste in devoting himself to the study of the
    antique and to antiquarian research. These two pictures, in spite of
    their cold classicism and theatricality, met with sensational success
    on their first appearance at the Salon. It is not in such works as
    these, nor in the <cite>Rape of the Sabine Women</cite> (No. 188), compared with
    which even Poussin’s version of the same theme appears like a glimpse
    of actual life, that David’s talent found its happiest expression,
    but in the unaffected and irresistibly charming <cite>Portrait of Mme.
    Récamier</cite> (No. 199, <a href="#i_plate45">Plate XLV.</a>) reclining on an Empire sofa. Whatever
    this picture may owe to the sitter’s grace and beauty and to the fact
    that it was never finished, and thus retained the freshness of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
    sketch, it is certainly one of the most attractive masterpieces of the
    French school. Here, as in the group of <cite>Three Ladies of Ghent</cite> (No.
    200<span class="smcap">a</span>), in which the luminous quality of the fresh tones is
    enhanced by the general greyness of the scheme, we have the work of
    a real painter, whilst David’s bombastic historical compositions are
    scarcely more than tinted cartoons.</p>

  <h3 id="THE_CORONATION_PICTURE">THE “CORONATION” PICTURE</h3>

  <p>When Napoleon rose to power, David became his favourite painter. The
    erstwhile Jacobin was chosen to paint the official <cite>Coronation</cite> picture
    (No. 202<span class="smcap">a</span>), an enormous canvas, which, like most ceremonial
    pictures of this kind, has more historical than artistic significance.
    The lifelike portraiture of the numerous personages surrounding the
    central group of Napoleon placing the crown on Josephine’s head, is
    the chief point of interest. On the restoration of the Bourbons in
    1815, David was sent into exile. He died at Brussels in 1825; but his
    influence is reflected in official French art to this day. It was he
    who imposed upon the modern academic school a rigid canon of formal
    classic beauty which is fatal to evolution and progress, because it
    does not permit personal emotional expression.</p>

  <p>Less severely classic in form, and showing at least an attempt at
    approaching a little nearer to truth than David, is the painting of
    the figures of <cite>The Three Graces</cite> (No. 769), by David’s rival, J.
    B. Regnault (1754–1829), in the La Caze collection. The worst type
    of academic art is represented in the bituminous reconstructions of
    classic antiquity by his pupil, P. N. Guérin (1774–1833), whose <cite>Return
    of Marcus Sextus</cite> (No. 393) enjoyed, perhaps owing to its supposed
    political allusion to the return of the emigrants, a success which
    cannot be accounted for on artistic grounds.</p>

  <p>Among the numerous pupils and followers of David who rose to fame,
    honours, and wide popularity before Ingres became the acknowledged
    head of the official school, the most distinguished were Gérard,
    Girodet, and Gros. Baron F. P. S. Gérard (1770–1837), whilst following
    on the whole the principles laid down by his master, knew how to
    invest his work with more individual character, which stood him in
    particular good stead in his portraiture. That this was recognised
    by his contemporaries is proved by the fact that he became the
    portrait painter <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of the First Empire and the Bourbon
    restoration, although his inclination drew him towards allegory and
    mythology. There is undeniable distinction and fine characterisation
    in such portraits as <cite>The Painter Isabey and his Daughter</cite> (No. 332).
    The nature of the subject debarred him from showing the strongest side
    of his talent in the chillingly unemotional, but undeniably graceful,
    <cite>Psyche receiving Cupid’s First Kiss</cite> (No. 328), and in the <cite>Daphnis
    and Chloë</cite> (No. 329), which was bought in 1825 for £1000. They have
    their counterpart in the cold and antique French sculpture of the
    period.</p>

  <p>A. L. Girodet de Roucy-Trioson (1767–1824) was of all David’s artistic
    progeny the one painter who devoted himself to the purely pictorial
    problem of concentrated light and shade, without, however, being able
    to free himself from the domination of linear design. The compromise
    of the two principles led to such unfortunate results as <cite>The Sleep
    of Endymion</cite> (No. 361) and <cite>The Burial of Atala</cite> (No. 362). In <cite>The
    Deluge</cite> (No. 360), which was painted later, he shows pronounced
    leanings towards a crude naturalism which exceeds in horror the most
    cruel inventions of Ribera’s genius.</p>

  <p>Antoine Jean Gros (1771–1835), though a classicist by training, was
    forced by circumstances, and by the patronage of Napoleon who ennobled
    him, to devote his brush to an important phase of contemporary life—the
    glorification of his hero’s warlike achievements. He was by no means a
    realist; and although he followed Napoleon on many of his campaigns and
    presumably brought back with him rich material in sketches and vivid
    recollections, his forceful compositions accentuate the heroic aspect
    and the imaginative appeal of warfare, and are not spontaneous glimpses
    of actuality. The whole glamour of the Napoleonic legend is expressed
    in the group of wounded soldiers who, oblivious of their suffering,
    cheer their great captain in <cite>Napoleon at the Battle of Eylau</cite> (No.
    389). The sense of the heroic is as pronounced in the large painting,
    <cite>Napoleon visiting the Plague-stricken at Jaffa</cite> (No. 388), in the
    <cite>Bonaparte at Arcole</cite> (No. 391), and even in the impressive <cite>Portrait
    of Lieutenant-General Fournier-Sarlovèze</cite> (No. 392<span class="smcap">a</span>),
    silhouetted against a smoke-filled battlefield. A careful inspection
    of this large canvas shows <i>pentimenti</i> in the painting of the legs,
    of which the General seems now to have two pair! Gros’s weakness, like
    that of all David’s pupils, was his neglect of colour. His popularity
    waned rapidly after the fall of Napoleon. He became a victim to
    melancholia, and drowned himself in the Seine in 1835.</p>

  <h3 id="PIERRE_PRUDHON">PIERRE PRUD’HON</h3>

  <p>Though not entirely detached from the ruling school of the period,
    Pierre Prud’hon (1758–1823) occupies a unique position among his
    contemporaries. Having absolved his preliminary studies at Dijon, he
    became the pupil of the old masters—of Correggio and Leonardo—first
    in Paris and then in Rome, where he worked for seven years before
    definitely settling at Paris in 1789. To his sympathy with the
    Italian masters he owed that mellowness of colour and understanding
    of chiaroscuro which escaped the grasp of the Davidists. He was a
    real <em>painter</em> as distinguished from the classicist <em>draughtsmen</em> of
    the official school. Even if it is impossible to share to-day the
    enthusiasm at one time evoked by the somewhat grotesque allegory,
    <cite>Justice and Divine Vengeance pursuing Crime</cite> (No. 747), this picture,
    which was intended for the Palais de Justice, rises immeasurably above
    the average of the “imaginative” paintings produced by Prud’hon’s
    contemporaries.</p>

  <p>Vastly superior as regards pictorial quality and the whole conception,
    is the <cite>Abduction of Psyche by Zephyrus</cite> (No. 756). In the
    <cite>Crucifixion</cite> (No. 744), his last picture, Prud’hon rises to telling
    dramatic effectiveness of colour, and heralds the advent of Delacroix.
    But the most masterly of his seventeen paintings at the Louvre is the
    magnificent <cite>Portrait of a Young Man</cite> (No. 753), which the Louvre was
    fortunate enough to secure for £35 in 1895. It is a strangely living
    evocation of a personality, searching, intimate, and mysterious—a
    portrait not so much of the superficial features, but of the inner life
    of the sitter. The large <cite>Portrait of the Empress Joséphine</cite> (No. 751)
    suffers from comparison with this masterpiece. The pose is affected,
    the background dingy, and the red of the shawl introduces a harsh and
    disconnected note of colour.</p>

  <h3 id="GERICAULT">GÉRICAULT</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE revolutionary movement of the Romanticists, which was to find a
    strong leader in Eugène Delacroix, may be said to have been initiated
    by Géricault’s epoch-making picture <cite>The Raft of the Medusa</cite> (No. 338,
    <a href="#i_plate46">Plate XLVI.</a>). Théodore Géricault (1791–1824), a pupil of Carle Vernet
    and Guérin, was an unusually gifted draughtsman, who from the outset
    strove to go beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> the dead perfection of the David school, and to
    infuse into his work the spark of life. The <cite>Raft of the Medusa</cite>, which
    caused an enormous stir at the Salon of 1819, was inspired by a tragic
    incident from actual life; and Géricault was the first who dared to
    represent in all its horrible reality this scene of human suffering—the
    survivors of a shipwreck driven by hunger to madness and mutual
    destruction. He set aside all arbitrarily ignored canons of formal
    beauty and the “grand style,” and applied himself to depicting fierce
    passions and emotions.</p>

  <p>Géricault was a passionate lover of horses; but his knowledge of equine
    anatomy did not prevent him, in his portrait of an <cite>Officer of the
    Guard</cite> (No. 339), from exaggerating the action of the charging horse to
    a point dangerously near the border-line between the sublime and the
    ridiculous. Most of his other pictures at the Louvre are studies of
    soldiers, and horses on the race-course or in the stable. He died in
    1824 from the effects of a fall from a horse.</p>

  <h3 id="DELACROIX">DELACROIX</h3>

  <p>The topical interest of the <cite>Raft of the Medusa</cite> had caused the public
    to receive this picture with favour, in spite of its daring departure
    from the generally accepted canons of the “grand style.” The case was
    different when Delacroix showed at the Salon of 1822 the <cite>Dante and
    Virgil</cite> (No. 207, <a href="#i_plate47">Plate XLVII.</a>), which was inspired by Géricault’s
    great picture, but applied that artist’s principles to a subject taken
    from literature,—from Dante’s “Inferno,”—and was therefore considered
    as a direct challenge to the academic host. To-day it is difficult to
    understand the indignation aroused by the young artist, who became
    forthwith the acknowledged head of the so-called Romanticist school,
    although he refrained from taking part in any propaganda. In this,
    his first important exhibited picture, he proved himself <span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>a true
    painter in the sense in which Rubens was a painter—that is to say,
    he no longer gave primary importance to drawing, with colour added
    afterwards in the manner of a tinted cartoon. In the <cite>Dante and Virgil</cite>
    colour and the actual sweep of the brush assumed at once a vital and
    constructive function, no longer separable from drawing and design.</p>

  <p>Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who belonged to a family that had given
    to France many distinguished statesmen and soldiers, was a pupil
    of Guérin, whose conventional teaching, however, was little to the
    taste of a young man whose passionate nature had been fired by his
    extensive reading of romantic literature, and who preferred to form
    his style on the works of Rubens and other old masters at the Louvre,
    and to benefit from his intercourse with Géricault and Bonington. The
    <cite>Dante and Virgil</cite>, which is now in a deplorable state of neglect, was
    bought by the State at the not very generous price of £50. Delacroix’s
    next Salon picture, <cite>The Massacre of Scio</cite> (No. 208), caused an even
    greater storm of abuse of the young artist who had dared to depict the
    horrors of this scene from the Greek War of Independence, as it was
    thought, in all their crudeness, without the heroical and theatrical
    poses that were deemed necessary for pictorial “histories.” The
    magnificent atmospheric background owes its origin to Delacroix’s
    first acquaintance with the <cite>Hay Wain</cite> and two other pictures sent by
    Constable to the Salon of 1824, which caused the impetuous young artist
    to repaint in a few days the sky and landscape. The picture was again
    bought by the State, the price this time being raised to £240. A superb
    study for the dead mother and child in the right-hand corner has been
    bequeathed by M. Cheramy, the present owner, to the National Gallery,
    where it is to be hung next to “the best Constable.”</p>

  <p>It is impossible here to give a full account of the twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>-one
    paintings by Delacroix at the Louvre, to which should be added his
    decorative masterpiece, the centre of the ceiling in the Galerie
    d’Apollon. We must content ourselves with a brief reference to his
    more important canvases, first of which in order of date is <cite>The 28th
    of July 1830: Liberty leading the People</cite> (No. 209), better known as
    <cite>The Barricade</cite>. The introduction of a bourgeois with a top-hat in this
    stirring scene of contemporary heroism was another act of defiance.
    But the dramatic power of the conception, which suffers but is by no
    means destroyed by the wretched allegorical figure of Liberty, and
    the artist’s appeal to political passion, caused the picture to be an
    enormous success.</p>

  <h3 id="DELACROIXS_ORIENTAL_PICTURES">DELACROIX’S ORIENTAL PICTURES</h3>

  <p>Delacroix’s journey to Morocco, with Count Morney’s mission in 1832,
    was of the greatest benefit to the artist’s progress as a colourist.
    although he had no time during his travels to paint any pictures, he
    brought back with him a wealth of rapid sketches which, with his vivid
    recollections of Eastern life and colour, led to the production of such
    masterpieces as the <cite>Algerian Women in their Apartment</cite> (No. 210), the
    <cite>Jewish Wedding in Morocco</cite> (No. 211), and <cite>The Entry of the Crusaders
    into Constantinople</cite> (No. 213). In the sumptuous scheme of <cite>Crusaders</cite>
    the last traces of the influence of Gros’s colourless palette have
    vanished. The picture was commissioned by Louis Philippe for the
    Château at Versailles, the remuneration being fixed at £400. A copy of
    the picture is in one of the Salles des Croisades at Versailles, and
    a small sketch is at Chantilly. The <cite>Algerian Women</cite> is particularly
    remarkable for the luminous sparkle of rich pigment through the ambient
    of silvery atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Among Delacroix’s masterpieces must be counted the <cite>Portrait of
    the Artist</cite> (No. 214), which he left on his death to his servant,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>Jenny le Guillon, stipulating that she should give it to the Louvre
    on the day of the restoration of the Orléans family—an event which
    never happened, though the picture reached its destination in 1872
    through the generosity of Mme. Durien. <cite>The Shipwreck of Don Juan</cite> (No.
    212), painted in 1840, is based on Lord Byron’s epic poem, of which
    it is, however, by no means a literal illustration. It is one of the
    most stirring renderings of human passion and despair in the whole
    history of art, the livid light and general sombre scheme of colour
    contributing towards the tragic effect, as though Nature herself were
    entering into the mood of the horrible scene.</p>

  <p>Although, on the whole, an unsatisfactory picture, Delacroix’s <cite>Roger
    delivering Angelica</cite> (No. 2845) may serve to illustrate the true
    significance of his art in its relation to the official school, as
    there is in the same collection another rendering of the identical
    subject (No. 419) by his great antagonist Ingres, the greatest
    draughtsman of his century, and the acknowledged leader of the
    Classicist school. Comparison between the two works will show that
    Delacroix’s version, with all its obvious imperfections, far surpasses
    Ingres’s in emotional intensity and fierce vitality. The academic
    perfection and exquisite finish of Ingres’s picture only accentuate the
    dulness and lifelessness of his conception.</p>

  <h3 id="INGRES">INGRES</h3>

  <p>Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780–1867) was a pupil of David. Having
    gained the Prix de Rome in 1801, he did not leave for Italy until 1806,
    but spent the next eighteen years in Rome and Florence, returning to
    Paris in 1824. Although Ingres was brought up in the cold tradition of
    the David school, he had a much clearer perception of the true spirit
    of Greek art than his master. When he became acquainted with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
    work of Raphael in Rome, he found it the very acme of perfection, and
    henceforth frankly strove to emulate that master, seeking to arrive
    at an eclectic ideal of the human form which in its dogmatic rule of
    the proportions that constitute absolute beauty, allowed none of the
    accents and variations which make for life and character. Himself
    greater than his theories, Ingres achieved that perfection of grace
    and beauty in his deservedly famous <cite>The Spring</cite> (No. 422, <a href="#i_plate48">Plate
    XLVIII.</a>), one of the few “gems” in the Salle Duchâtel, and in the very
    Raphaelesque <cite>Odalisque</cite> (No. 422<span class="smcap">b</span>), which was purchased in
    1899 from the Princesse de Sagan for £2400. On the other hand, the
    imposition of an inflexible, rigid ideal of form did incalculable harm
    to his numerous and less gifted followers, in whom every spark of
    individuality was extinguished by the tyranny of the dogma.</p>

  <p>Yet Ingres, when he applied himself to portraiture, was as
    uncompromising a realist as Holbein, of whose sensitive, subtle drawing
    and plastic modelling, without the introduction of entirely unnecessary
    shiny high lights, we are forcibly reminded by the <cite>Portrait of the
    Painter’s Friend, M. Bochet</cite> (No. 428<span class="smcap">a</span>). Something of the same
    perfection of modelling, suggested rather by the sensitive contour than
    clearly stated by pronounced lights and shadows, is to be noticed in
    the nude figure of <cite>The Odalisque</cite>, and in the creamy white drapings
    of the oval <cite>Portrait of Mme. Rivière</cite> (No. 427). Perhaps his best
    portrait at the Louvre is the one of <cite>M. Bertin, Founder of the Journal
    des Débats</cite> (No. 428<span class="smcap">b</span>), a masterpiece of character painting,
    in which the marvellously drawn fleshy hands, with their tapering
    fingers, are as expressive as the fine head. This portrait was acquired
    in 1897 for the sum of £3200.</p>

  <p>The less admirable side of Ingres’s talent is illustrated by
    the circular composition of the <cite>Virgin of the Host</cite> (No. 416),
    a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>crude scheme of “Sassoferrato blue” and red, on entirely
    conventional lines; and by the <cite>Apotheosis of Homer</cite> (No. 417), a tame
    Raphaelesque design in which Homer is seen enthroned in the centre,
    with allegorical figures of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite> seated on the
    steps of the throne, and a winged goddess placing a laurel wreath on
    his head. To the left of the central group are the figures of Hesiod,
    Æschylus, Apelles, Raphael, Virgil, Dante, Tasso, Corneille, and
    Poussin; to the right, Pindar, Plato, Socrates, Alexander, Camoens,
    Racine, Molière, and Fénelon. There is a touch of the grotesque in the
    combination of rather mechanical dry portraiture with trite allegory
    that constitutes the design of the terribly cracked <cite>Portrait of the
    Composer Cherubini</cite> (No. 418). His failings as a colourist are most
    aggressively obvious in the <cite>Christ handing the Keys to St. Peter</cite> (No.
    415). Ingres died in Paris on the 14th January 1867.</p>

  <h3 id="DELAROCHE_AND_SCHEFFER">DELAROCHE AND SCHEFFER</h3>

  <p>Among the painters who were influenced by Delacroix, and whose name was
    associated with the Romanticist movement, none rose to greater fame
    than Paul Delaroche (1797–1856), a pupil of Gros, and the Dutchman Ary
    Scheffer (1795–1858), who, like Delacroix, studied under Guérin. But
    neither of these artists managed wholly to shake off the trammels of
    the academic tradition, and both became popular for the very reasons
    for which a more critical generation has denied them the right to
    figure among the world’s great artists: Delaroche for the theatricality
    of his historical anecdotes, of which <cite>The Death of Queen Elizabeth</cite>
    (No. 216) and <cite>The Princes in the Tower</cite> (No. 217) are typical
    examples; and Scheffer for the sickly sentimentality displayed in such
    pictures as <cite>St. Augustine and St. Monica</cite> (No. 841).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

  <p>Contemporary with the fighters in the great battle between the
    Romanticists and the Classicists were a group of able painters who were
    not connected with either of these main currents of artistic thought,
    but drew their inspiration from the Dutch genre painters. <cite>The Arrival
    of a Diligence at the Messageries</cite> (No. 28), by Louis Leopold Boilly
    (1761–1845), and <cite>The Interior of a Kitchen</cite> (No. 261), by Martin
    Drolling (1752–1817), may be quoted as characteristic instances of
    these “small masters” without possessing the luminosity of their Dutch
    exemplars.</p>

  <h3 id="DECAMPS">DECAMPS</h3>

  <p>Something of the precious quality of pigment and of the luminosity
    of these Dutchmen is to be found in the genre pictures of Alexandre
    Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), of which a large number form part of
    the Thomy Thiéry Bequest—notably <cite>The Knife-Grinder</cite> (No. 2831)
    and <cite>The Gipsy Encampment</cite> (No. 2833). Decamps owes his historical
    importance to his position as the head of the Orientalists. Unlike his
    contemporary explorer of the East for pictorial purposes, Delacroix,
    he found the facts of Eastern life, scenery, and customs sufficiently
    attractive to be satisfied with the realistic statement of his visual
    impressions, instead of making them the basis for the invention of
    romantic incidents. Yet the <cite>Street in Smyrna</cite> (No. 2827) and similar
    works are by no means of merely topographic interest, for Decamps was
    a great painter to whom pigment yielded beauty independent of the
    subject represented. <cite>The Rat retired from the World</cite> (No. 2834) vies
    in quality with the still-life pictures of Chardin. Decamps was also
    the greatest animal painter of his time, as may be gathered from his
    <cite>Chevaux de halage</cite> (No. 204), <cite>The Bull-Dog and Scotch Terrier</cite> (No.
    206), and the precious little genre piece, <cite>The Kennel-Boy</cite> (No. 2838).</p>

  <p>Brought up in the tradition of the Classicist school, Prosper Marilhat
    (1811–1847) only “formed himself” when the world of colour was
    discovered to him under the glowing sky of the Holy Land and Egypt,
    where he painted <cite>The Mosque of the Khalif Hakem, at Cairo</cite> (No.
    615). Another Orientalist of great distinction, who, after being a
    favourite pupil of Ingres, became attracted by the fiery romanticism of
    Delacroix, was the Creole Théodore Chassériau (1819–1856). His works
    at the Louvre illustrate the earlier better than the later phase of
    his art. Chassériau was still entirely under the spell of Ingres when
    he painted, in 1844, the decoration of the Cour des Comptes, which
    building was destroyed under the Commune. <cite>Peace</cite> (No. 121<span class="smcap">a</span>)
    is a fragment of this important decorative work, which may be said to
    constitute a link between Ingres and Puvis de Chavannes. <cite>The Chaste
    Susannah</cite> (No. 121) and the <cite>Portrait of Father Lacordaire, Dominican
    Preacher</cite> (No. 121<span class="smcap">b</span>), are again clear evidence of Ingres’s
    influence upon Chassériau at the beginning of his brief career.</p>

  <p>A man of profound culture and rare critical acumen, Eugène Fromentin
    (1820–1876) was perhaps greater as a critic than as a painter. He, too,
    travelled repeatedly in Algeria and Egypt, where he found abundant
    material both for his brush and pen. He did not look upon the East
    with the curiosity of the traveller, nor did he let the strange land
    work upon his romantic imagination. His pictures, somewhat timid in
    technique but marked by great refinement, reveal, on the other hand, a
    thorough understanding of the sad monotony of the sun-parched desert,
    and the chivalrous, noble bearing of its Arab inhabitants. His refined
    talent shows to best advantage in <cite>Hawking in Algeria</cite> (No. 305).</p>

    <h3 id="REGNAULT">REGNAULT</h3>

  <p>The Orient was by no means the uncontested field of the Romanticists.
    But the followers of the official school who devoted themselves to
    the depicting of Eastern life and scenery, approached these subjects
    in the same spirit of <i lang="fr">parti pris</i> which robs all their work of real
    significance—unless, like Henri Regnault (1843–1871) in his famous
    and often reproduced <cite>Moorish Execution</cite> (No. 771), they treated them
    as rank melodrama. Regnault is, however, not to be judged by this
    overrated piece of sensationalism. Killed in the Franco-German War in
    1871 at the early age of twenty-eight, this young painter gave rare
    promise of brilliant achievement in an altogether unacademic direction
    in his superb equestrian portrait of <cite>General Prim</cite> (No. 770). There is
    something truly heroic in the way the Spanish general sits his horse,
    arresting its forward movement with a sudden jerk at the reins; but
    the ruggedness and unkempt appearance of the rider displeased General
    Prim to such an extent that Regnault, who would not alter the picture,
    preferred to keep it on his hands.</p>

  <h3 id="ACADEMIC_PAINTERS">ACADEMIC PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>It will suffice here merely to indicate the names and chief works at
    the Louvre of the principal artists who carried on, about the middle of
    the nineteenth century, the academic tradition,—capable painters all,
    but without clearly-marked individuality. Thomas Couture (1815–1879),
    a pupil of Gros and of Delaroche, in painting the huge composition,
    <cite>Romans of the Decadence</cite> (No. 156), produced a picture which may be
    taken as typical of the ambitions and failings of the whole school—of
    their literary tendencies, theatricality, and uninspired dulness. He
    was, however, an accomplished master of technique, which is more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
    can be said of Joseph Devéria (1805–1865), the painter of <cite>The Birth
    of Henri IV.</cite> (No. 250); or of Ingres’s pupil, the dull Hippolyte
    Flandrin (1809–1864), who is only represented by two <cite>Portraits</cite> (Nos.
    284 and 285). Nor is it possible to-day to grow enthusiastic over the
    historical paintings of Joseph Nicolas Robert-Fleury (1797–1890), whose
    <cite>Conference at Poissy</cite> (No. 2982), <cite>Galileo before the Inquisition</cite>
    (No. 2983), and <cite>Christopher Columbus received by Ferdinand and
    Isabella on his Return from America</cite> (No. 2984), can only be regarded
    as unnecessarily large coloured illustrations.</p>

  <h3 id="MICHEL_AND_HUET">MICHEL AND HUET</h3>

  <p>In the much-neglected branch of landscape painting the classic
    tradition of Claude ruled supreme until a new conception arose with
    the victory of the romantics in the third decade of the nineteenth
    century. Two names only need be mentioned before we pass on to the
    new movement—the return to nature—which was inaugurated by the group
    of painters vaguely known as the Barbizon school. Both Georges Michel
    (1763–1843) and Paul Huet (1804–1868) may be regarded as forerunners
    of that great movement; and both have only in recent years received
    the recognition which is their due. Michel developed his style in
    copying and closely studying the Dutch landscape masters, and must
    in his maturity have been well acquainted with the art of Constable,
    who exercised, together with Bonington, a prodigious influence on the
    whole course of French landscape painting. If Michel’s breadth of
    style, which may be judged from <cite>Near Montmartre</cite> (No. 626), had been
    accompanied by a greater range of subject-matter, he would probably
    rank more highly in the roll of French artists; but he contented
    himself with the endless repetition of the same motifs which he found
    close to Montmartre, where he spent his whole life. The care with which
    he studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> the works of Jacob van Ruisdael earned for him the nickname
    of “the Ruisdael of Montmartre.”</p>

  <p>Huet, again, learnt more from the old masters and from his friends,
    Bonington and Delacroix, than from his actual teachers. He, too,
    thrust aside the recipes of composing classic or “noble” landscapes,
    and was inspired by an altogether emotional outlook upon nature, calm
    and serene, as in <cite>The Still Morning</cite> (No. 413), or threatening and
    tempestuous, as in <cite>The Inundation at St. Cloud</cite> (No. 412), or in his
    masterpiece, <cite>The Breakers at Granville</cite> (No. 2952).</p>

  <h3 id="THE_BARBIZON_SCHOOL">THE BARBIZON SCHOOL</h3>

  <p>The term “Barbizon school” has been extended from its narrower meaning,
    in which it merely comprises Rousseau, Diaz, Millet and the disciples
    who joined them, to form a little artistic colony on the edge of the
    Forest of Fontainebleau, to a less accurate but now generally accepted
    wider application, embracing “the men of 1830,” who collectively and
    individually set out, inspired indirectly by Constable, upon the
    conquest of light and atmosphere through intimate communion with
    nature. In a pedantic survey of this Barbizon school, Rousseau would
    have to take honour of place as the leader of the group, whilst Corot
    and Daubigny, neither of whom actually worked at Barbizon, would have
    to be altogether excluded. But in the more liberal interpretation of
    the term, which we have here adopted, Jean Baptiste Camille Corot
    (1796–1875) must be given first place as the doyen of the whole group,
    since he alone was born before the eighteenth century had run its
    course.</p>

  <h3 id="COROT">COROT</h3>

  <p>Corot, the son of a <i lang="fr">coiffeur</i> and a <i lang="fr">modiste</i> in comfortable
    circumstances, was destined in his youth for the drapery trade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> and
    was only enabled to follow his bent for the artistic profession when,
    at the age of twenty-five, he entered into possession of a small
    annual allowance, sufficient to meet his modest requirements and to
    save him from the desperate struggle for very existence which was the
    fate of some of his later friends and companions. His early work from
    nature had already laid the foundations for his subsequent style when
    he entered the studio, first of the academic painter Michallon, and
    then of Bertin. In 1825 Corot went to Rome, where he painted, among
    many pictures of equally rich luscious quality, the <cite>View of the Forum
    Romanum</cite> (No. 139), and the <cite>View of the Coliseum</cite> (No. 140), which
    he himself bequeathed to the State. Although these early works have
    none of the elusive charm and lyrical feeling of his mature style,
    and are of rather topographic character, they reveal in every touch
    the artist enamoured of atmosphere and of the quality of pigment. The
    touch is precise, but not tight. The two pictures were painted in 1826,
    but already they hold more than a hint of that unrivalled mastery of
    tone-values which found supreme expression in <cite>A Street in Douai</cite> (No.
    141<span class="smcap">f</span>), painted in 1871.</p>

  <p>From the precision of his early manner Corot gradually advanced to
    freedom and airy looseness of touch; from statement of fact, to the
    suggestion of the very spirit and essence of nature in terms of paint
    that, more than any other artist’s work, justify the expression
    “colour music.” His later canvases are filled with the soft shimmer
    of vibrating atmosphere and with the tender poetry of dawn and dusk.
    Whilst retaining a truly classic sense of style, and adapting nature
    to his purposes by arrangement and generalisation, he never fails
    to convince the beholder of the reality of the scene represented.
    Even if his glades are peopled with dancing nymphs and satyrs, as
    in <cite>A Morning</cite> (No. 138), these mythical beings no longer suggest
    classic statuary, but they belong as much to the landscape as do the
    trees and shrubs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> and clouds, as do the peasant woman and the cow in
    <cite>The Dell</cite> (No. 2801, <a href="#i_plate49">Plate XLIX.</a>), or the piping shepherd in the
    exquisite <cite>Souvenir d’Italie: Castel Gandolfo</cite> (No. 141<span class="smcap">b</span>).
    Of the twenty-two paintings by the master at the Louvre, no fewer
    than twelve form part of the Thomy Thiéry Bequest to which the great
    French national collection owes so many of its chief treasures of
    nineteenth-century art.</p>

  <h3 id="T_ROUSSEAU">T. ROUSSEAU</h3>

  <p>The real head of the Barbizon school was Théodore Rousseau (1812–1867),
    who was one of the first exponents of the “romantic” as opposed to the
    “classic” landscape. If Corot was the lyric, Rousseau was the epic
    poet of Nature. In his early works he was considerably influenced
    by Constable, but he failed for a long time to gain the approval of
    the public and of the Salon juries. Fourteen times in succession his
    pictures were refused admission to the Salon, and success only came to
    him late in life. In 1851, at about the same time as Millet, he settled
    at Barbizon, on the outskirts of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where
    henceforth he found the subjects for his pictures. Rousseau was a most
    conscientious artist, who “constructed a group of trees with the care
    that an Academician puts into the construction of a nude figure.” His
    love of accurate detail did not, however, make him lose sight of the
    general effect. His insistence on bold silhouettes made him favour the
    sunset hour when, as in his masterpiece, <cite>An Opening in the Forest at
    Fontainebleau</cite> (No. 827), the trees would form effective dark masses
    against the glowing sunset sky. More characteristic of his favourite
    manner of composition is the imposing group of oak trees in the middle
    of a plain in the picture known as <cite>Les Chênes</cite> (No. 2900). In this,
    as in <cite>Marais dans les Landes</cite> (No. 830), which was bought in 1881 for
    £5160, and, indeed, in all the pictures where cattle are introduced,
    it will be noticed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>that the animals form part and parcel of the
    landscape, and are no longer individual “portraits” of animals, as they
    were apt to be in the pictures by the earlier Dutch cattle-painters.
    The same unity of vision is to be noted in all his sixteen pictures at
    the Louvre.</p>

  </div>

  <h3 id="C_TROYON">C. TROYON</h3>

  <p>This oneness of inanimate and animate nature is less completely
    realised in the art of Constant Troyon (1810–1865), who, having been
    trained as a porcelain-painter, was subsequently attracted by the
    romanticism of Dupré, but followed such Dutch masters as Paul Potter in
    subordinating the landscape to the cattle. It is for this reason that
    Troyon is known to the public as a “cattle-painter” rather than as a
    landscape painter. At the same time, he was a close observer of the
    effects of light on fields and meadows, which he rendered with a skill
    only rivalled by the solidity, the suggestion of weight and movement,
    the well-accentuated forms and sinuosities of his cattle. The huge
    canvas <cite>Oxen going to Work</cite> (No. 889) is an unrivalled achievement of
    its kind—a piece of realism that is not without poetry and grandeur.
    Next to it in importance ranks the <cite>Return to the Farm</cite> (No. 890).
    Among the eleven Troyons (Nos. 2906–2916) of the Thomy Thiéry Bequest,
    the <cite>Morning</cite> (No. 2909) strikes a more cheerful and hopeful note than
    is this artist’s wont.</p>

  <p>Another artist of this group, who devoted himself almost exclusively
    to the painting of sheep, is Charles Jacque (1813–1894), from whose
    brush the Louvre owns the <cite>Flock of Sheep in a Landscape</cite> (No.
    430<span class="smcap">a</span>), a characteristic work of unusually large dimensions.</p>

  <h3 id="J_DUPRE">J. DUPRÉ</h3>

  <p>Jules Dupré (1811–1889) began, like Troyon, as a china-painter, and,
    like Rousseau, with whom he was for years on terms of intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
    friendship, benefited by the example of Constable, whose art he had
    presumably occasion to study during a visit to England. It was from him
    that he acquired the sense of movement in nature, which is so much more
    pronounced in his landscapes than in Rousseau’s, whom he exceeded in
    breadth of touch and in power. More particularly in his later manner he
    loved to apply his colours in a thick impasto laid on to every part of
    the canvas, including the sky. Only on rare occasions did he adopt the
    more fluid, suave manner shown in <cite>Morning</cite> (No. 2940) and <cite>Evening</cite>
    (No. 2941), the two decorative panels executed for Prince Demidoff, and
    acquired by the Louvre in 1880 at the San Donato sale. More typical of
    his virile, forceful style are the twelve signed pictures by Dupré in
    the Thomy Thiéry Bequest (Nos. 2864–2875), especially the fine autumn
    landscape <cite>The Pond</cite> (No. 2867, <a href="#i_plate50">Plate L.</a>), the intensely sad, sunless
    <cite>Flock in the Landes</cite> (No. 2871), <cite>The Large Oak</cite> (No. 2873), and
    <cite>The Sunset on a Marsh</cite> (No. 2874), with the golden glow of the sky
    reflected in the water.</p>

  <p>Before turning to Diaz, who has been aptly called “the most romantic of
    the Romanticists,” we must briefly mention Eugène Isabey (1804–1886),
    who connects the art of the First Empire with Romanticism, and who
    knew how to invest his historical paintings with genuinely pictorial
    interest at a time when that class of subject was generally treated
    from the literary and anecdotal point of view. His exuberant
    temperament led him not infrequently to exaggerated movement. The
    twelve pictures which bear his signature at the Louvre (Nos. 2878–2884,
    2953–2956, and 2953<span class="smcap">a</span>) are illustrative of every phase of
    his art. As a landscape painter he may be considered a forerunner of
    Rousseau.</p>

  <h3 id="DIAZ">DIAZ</h3>

  <p>Narcisse Diaz de la Peña (1809–1876) was born at Bordeaux, the son of
    political fugitives from Spain, and, like so many artists <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>of this
    group, started his artistic career as a china-painter. He afterwards
    gained considerable success with his romantic figure pictures of
    mythological and Oriental subjects, like the <cite>Nymphs in a Wood</cite> (No.
    2854), <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite> (No. 2858), <cite>Venus disarming Cupid</cite> (No.
    2859), and above all the <cite>Fée aux Perles</cite> (No. 256). As a landscape
    painter he delighted in rendering the sparkle of sunlight penetrating
    through the dense foliage of forest and brushwood. Diaz must be placed
    between Isabey and Millet, who followed his example in his early figure
    pieces; but he was also influenced by Rousseau and by Delacroix. Among
    his eighteen pictures at the Louvre are several landscapes of superb
    quality, notably the <cite>Study of a Birch Tree</cite> (No. 252), <cite>Sous Bois</cite>
    (No. 253), and <cite>Dogs in the Forest</cite> (No. 257<span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

  <h3 id="DAUBIGNY">DAUBIGNY</h3>

  <p>Of all the Barbizon painters and their artistic kinship, Charles
    François Daubigny (1817–1878) is the one who approached nature with the
    most reverent spirit. He is in a way the least subjective of them all,
    because his love of nature even in her simplest aspects prevented him
    from imposing his own personality upon her; and for this very reason he
    is more varied in his range of landscape subjects than any of the other
    masters of this important group. The most fugitive effects of light
    and atmosphere were seized by him with a masterly sureness which found
    expression in every touch of his summary brush. Every hour of the day,
    every season of the year, every mood of nature appealed to him with
    equal intensity, although the choice of his subjects is most frequently
    inspired by serene optimism.</p>

  <p>Daubigny belonged to a family of artists. He received his first
    instruction from his father, and afterwards studied under Delaroche.
    Before he began to paint landscapes in the neigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>bourhood of Paris,
    he gained his livelihood by painting sweet-boxes! He found his best
    subjects on the banks of the Oise, but worked also in other districts
    of France, in Italy, and in England. Of his sojourn in England we are
    reminded by <cite>The Thames at Erith</cite> (No. 2821), one of the thirteen
    Daubignys bequeathed to the Louvre by Thomy Thiéry, which also include
    the sun-flooded <cite>Weir Gate at Optevoz</cite> (No. 2818, <a href="#i_plate51">Plate LI.</a>), <cite>The
    Pond with Storks</cite> (No. 2815), <cite>Les Péniches</cite> (No. 2820), <cite>Morning on
    the River</cite> (No. 2824), and <cite>The Banks of the Oise</cite> (No. 2823). <cite>The
    Vintage in Burgundy</cite> (No. 184), which was bought by the State at
    the ridiculously low price of £400, is a picture of unusually large
    dimensions for an artist who generally needed but a small surface to
    express his ardent worship of nature. The delicious <cite>Spring</cite> (No.
    185), with its blossoming apple trees and young grass, must be counted
    among his finest achievements. It is a picture that fills the heart
    of the beholder with the joy and contentment engendered by the blithe
    atmosphere of a bright spring day in the country.</p>

  <h3 id="MILLET">MILLET</h3>

  <p>The Louvre is fortunate in possessing no fewer than a dozen pictures by
    Jean François Millet (1814–1875), the great painter of the peasant’s
    unceasing struggle with the forces of nature to gain his livelihood
    from the soil. Millet himself was the son of a peasant, and was kept
    busy with farm work until he had attained the age of twenty, when
    he began to study art at Cherbourg. His studies were repeatedly
    interrupted before he definitely took up art as his profession. Before
    he went to Barbizon, in 1849, to devote himself exclusively to the
    genre in which he was to achieve immortal fame, he gained popular
    favour and admission to the Salon by following the eighteenth-century
    tradition of mythological art, and painted a number of nude studies
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>of nymphs, goddesses, and cupids, not unlike in style to those
    of Diaz, but already marked by that firmness of design and by the
    monumental character that are so remarkable in his later work. The
    study of <cite>Bathing Women</cite> (No. 642) belongs to that period.</p>

  <p>After he had settled at Barbizon, Millet, whose peasant origin was
    probably the cause of his intense sympathy with the struggles and
    hardships of the field labourers’ fatiguing work, devoted his brush
    to creating that profoundly moving record of labour and toil which
    constitutes his claim to be considered one of the world’s great
    masters. He knew how to invest scenes of humble life with truly
    monumental grandeur, and brought out the hopeless monotony and cruel
    hardships of the life led by the tillers of the soil with such incisive
    strength, that he was accused of propagandist tendencies. Nothing,
    however, was further from his aim. He was an artist pure and simple,
    who, in following his own unpopular ideal, preferred to suffer neglect
    and extreme poverty to a compromise with the taste of the vulgar.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Women Gleaning</cite> (No. 644, <a href="#i_plate52">Plate LII.</a>) may be considered his
    supreme achievement, and an epitome of his whole art. Millet alone
    could have invested so bald and unpromising a subject with so much epic
    grandeur. There is in the rhythmic repetition of the action of the
    two women in the centre of the composition a sense of the inevitable
    hopeless monotony of labour in the fields, even if the picture is
    not “a plea against the misery of the people.” The same struggle for
    existence and the resulting physical fatigue are admirably expressed
    in the statuesquely silhouetted figure of <cite>The Weed-burner</cite> (No.
    2890). <cite>The Woodcutter</cite> (No. 2895), <cite>The Strawbinders</cite> (No. 2892), and
    <cite>The Winnower</cite> (No. 2893) all exemplify this phase of Millet’s art.
    The domestic life of the peasantry is treated with equally profound
    sympathy in <cite>Maternal Precaution</cite> (No. 2894), <cite>La Couseuse</cite> (No.
    644<span class="smcap">a</span>), and <cite>La Lessiveuse</cite> (No. 2891). Among his comparatively
    rare pure landscape subjects <cite>The Church of Gréville</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> (No. 641), which
    was found in an unfinished state in the artist’s studio after his
    death, takes very high rank. It is as remarkable for the simple telling
    truth with which the normal aspect of the landscape is rendered, as the
    <cite>Spring</cite> (No. 643) is for the realisation of a more uncommon effect—a
    rainbow and the shrill accent of sunlight in the orchard under the
    leaden grey of the departing thunder clouds.</p>

  <h3 id="DAUMIER">DAUMIER</h3>

  <p>What Millet did for the life of the country, Honoré Daumier (1808–1879)
    did for the life of the town, of which he was a shrewd and critical
    observer. But his long practice as a caricaturist made him look upon
    the types that engaged his brush with a certain cruel bitterness which
    is far removed from Millet’s human sympathy. With a palette restricted
    almost to black and grey, Daumier yet proved himself a great colourist
    through the infallible accuracy of his tone-values and the suggestion
    of rich colour in his almost monochrome schemes. His design is as
    massive and monumental as Millet’s. The touch of the <i lang="fr">macabre</i>, which
    is so characteristic of Daumier’s art, is very evident in <cite>The Thieves
    and the Donkey</cite> (No. 2937). The <cite>Portrait of the Painter Théodore
    Rousseau</cite> (No. 2938) holds a hint of the caricaturist’s vision.</p>

  <h3 id="COURBET">COURBET</h3>

  <p>Equally far removed from, and hostile to, Classicism and
    Romanticism was Gustave Courbet (1819–1877), who as head and
    founder of the Realistic school exercised a prodigious influence
    upon nineteenth-century art. He was essentially a fighting spirit,
    determined to overcome official hostility to his revolutionary
    principles. Excluded from public exhibitions, he held a private show
    of his own works, and defended his theories by spoken and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>written
    arguments. His just claim was that it did not matter <em>what</em> you paint,
    but <em>how</em> you paint what you actually see; and in conformity with
    his loudly proclaimed principles he often chose subjects that were
    offensive to the taste of his day. At the same time we can see now that
    he was endowed with a keen instinctive feeling for pictorial fitness,
    and that most of his pictures are far from being haphazard snapshots
    of actuality. In his student years he had copied many masterpieces by
    Rembrandt, Velazquez, Hals, and Van Dyck. How much he benefited from
    the example of the old masters is to be judged from his portrait of
    himself, known as <cite>The Man with the Leather-belt</cite> (No. 147).</p>

  <p>By far his most famous picture is the gigantic <cite>Funeral at Ornans</cite>
    (No. 143), which, as a study of the life and types in a small French
    provincial town, has aptly been compared with Flaubert’s great novel
    <cite>Madame Bovary</cite>. Each individual head in this vast composition is a
    marvellous study of facial expression. In his landscapes, again, he
    was by no means photographic, and he never failed to consider the
    decorative effectiveness of his pictures. His influence upon Whistler’s
    early work is to be judged from <cite>The Wave</cite> (No. 147<span class="smcap">a</span>). If his
    landscapes retain to a certain extent the atmosphere of the studio,
    such pieces as <cite>La Remise des Chevreuils</cite> (No. 145<span class="smcap">a</span>) and
    <cite>Le Ruisseau du Puits noir</cite> (No. 146<span class="smcap">a</span>) clearly show that he
    possessed a sound understanding of the way in which colours react upon,
    and modify, each other. Courbet’s revolutionary tendencies made him
    take part in the political movement of the Commune, and forced him to
    leave his native country. He died in Switzerland in 1877.</p>

  <h3 id="MEISSONIER">MEISSONIER</h3>

  <p>It was realism of a very different kind that made public opinion place
    Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier (1815–1891) on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> pinnacle, from which he
    has only in recent years been transferred to the more modest position
    due to him, for the exquisite minute care he bestowed upon the working
    out of insignificant details. Meissonier was a draughtsman and an
    illustrator rather than a painter. As a colourist he does not count.
    He had no appreciation of values, textures, substances, and surfaces.
    Nothing could be more to the point than Manet’s mordant remark that in
    Meissonier’s pictures “everything is of iron except the cuirasses.”
    Still, the mind that finds delight in small things will dwell with
    pleasure upon the microscopic details of his little costume pictures
    <cite>The Flute Player</cite> (No. 2887), <cite>The Poet</cite> (No. 2889), and several
    similar “gems” at the Louvre. Strangely enough the <cite>Portrait of Mme.
    Gerriot</cite> (No. 2965), which he painted at the age of nineteen, has more
    breadth and real character than any of his later works. The chief task
    of Meissonier’s life was the glorification of Napoleon <span class="smcap">i.</span>’s
    campaigns. Of this famous series the Louvre includes no example. On the
    other hand, the collection owns three important historical pictures
    from his brush in <cite>Napoleon III. at Solferino</cite> (No. 2957), which long
    hung in the Luxembourg Gallery, <cite>Napoleon III. surrounded by his Staff</cite>
    (No. 2958), and <cite>The Siege of Paris</cite> (No. 2969), in the painting of
    which he had at least the advantage of personal experience, as he had
    followed the Emperor’s army on the Italian campaign, and was in Paris
    during the siege. Altogether the Louvre owns no fewer than twenty-nine
    paintings by Meissonier.</p>

  <h3 id="RICARD">RICARD</h3>

  <p>If Meissonier is beginning to find his proper level after having been
    grossly overrated, Louis Gustave Ricard (1824–1873), one of the most
    remarkable portrait painters of his century, has only just in recent
    years been rescued from almost complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span> oblivion. A pupil of L.
    Cogniet, Ricard spent several years in copying the works and analysing
    the technical methods of the old masters, and in travelling in Italy,
    Belgium, Holland, and England. It was not before his return to Paris
    in 1850 that he began to exhibit. Ricard was exclusively a portrait
    painter. Technically his early studies enabled him to arrive at a
    method of singular morbidezza and warm luminosity. There is a certain
    truth in a modern critic’s description of Ricard’s pigments as being
    composed of “crushed jewels, flower juice, and gold and silver powder.”
    The great merit of Ricard’s portraits is, however, his extraordinary
    insight into his sitters’ psychology. To him a portrait meant more than
    a correct record of the model’s superficial aspect: he endeavoured to
    paint the very soul in so far as it can be read from eyes and lips.
    In this respect he is the descendant of Giorgione and the forerunner
    of Watts and Carrière. The portraits of <cite>The Painter Heilbuth</cite> (No.
    778<span class="smcap">a</span>), of <cite>Mme. de Calonne</cite> (No. 778<span class="smcap">e</span>), of <cite>His Own
    Portrait</cite> (No. 778), and the badly cracked <cite>Portrait of Paul de Musset</cite>
    (No. 778<span class="smcap">b</span>), may be quoted as admirable instances of his art.</p>

  <h3 id="MANET">MANET</h3>

  <p>We must close this necessarily fragmentary survey of French art at the
    Louvre with the mention of Edouard Manet (1832–1883), whose <cite>Olympia</cite>
    (No. 613<span class="smcap">a</span>, <a href="#i_plate53">Plate LIII.</a>) is the first, and so far the only
    painting of the Impressionist school that has gained access to this
    gallery. It was formerly exhibited at the Luxembourg. Hung as it is
    now in Gallery VIII. amid the works of David, Gros, Ingres, Delacroix,
    Delaroche, and other early nineteenth-century painters, this <cite>Olympia</cite>
    fully explains the sensation, but certainly not the indignation, caused
    by its first appearance at the Salon of 1865. It sings out with such
    brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> purity of colour and is so emphatic in the patterning of its
    design, so daring in the placing side by side of almost unmodulated but
    infallibly accurate colour masses, that everything around appears more
    or less dingy and artificial. Manet’s <cite>Olympia</cite> marks the dawn of a new
    era, not because it is based on a revolutionary rejection of tradition,
    but because it is true to the <em>spirit</em> of the best tradition, which is
    not carried on by literal and mechanical imitation, but by evolution
    and adaptation to modern life and thought.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IF the representation of French art at the National Gallery in London
    is admittedly meagre and inadequate, the British section at the Louvre
    can scarcely be considered worthy of serious consideration. Its entire
    removal, with the exception of about half a dozen pictures, would not
    only entail no serious loss to the collection, but would be an act
    of justice to the reputation of several great artists who are here
    made responsible for pictures upon which they presumably never set
    eyes. Under these circumstances it is quite impossible to illustrate
    the progress of British art by the two-score or so examples in the
    Long Gallery, part of which is devoted to the English pictures. Of
    the leading masters, Hogarth (1697–1764) and Gainsborough (1727–1788)
    will be vainly looked for, since the two <cite>Landscapes</cite> (Nos. 1811 and
    1811<span class="smcap">b</span>) attributed to the latter in the La Caze Room are
    inferior conventional compositions in Italian taste, which can no more
    be connected with the name of Gainsborough than the wretched <cite>Still
    Life</cite> which has lately been added to the Louvre collection.</p>

  <h3 id="CONSTABLE_AND_HIS_IMITATORS">CONSTABLE AND HIS IMITATORS</h3>

  <p>In view of the powerful influence exercised by Constable and the
    British Landscape school in general upon modern French art, it is
    surprising that no attempts should have been made to secure a few
    examples of greater importance and more certain authenticity than the
    ones now exhibited. Six pictures are catalogued under the name of John
    Constable (1776–1837); the only one that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> can be unreservedly accepted
    as the work of his brush is the little view of <cite>Hampstead Heath</cite> (No.
    1809, <a href="#i_plate54">Plate LIV.</a>), which was presented to the Louvre in 1877 by the
    painter’s son, Mr. Lionel Constable. It is a fresh, masterly study for
    the picture in the Sheepshanks collection at the Victoria and Albert
    Museum.</p>

  <p>The <cite>Weymouth Bay</cite> (No. 1808), which realised as much as £2240 at the
    Marquis de la Rochebrune’s sale in 1873, has been enthusiastically
    commented upon by Bürger, but cannot pass the ordeal of searching
    criticism. It is incoherent, and in the details of the foreground and
    the painting of the figures and sheep lacks the purposeful sureness of
    touch which is the hall-mark of Constable’s art. <cite>The Cottage</cite> (No.
    1806) has the same provenance. Mr. P. M. Turner, in an article in the
    <cite>Burlington Magazine</cite>, suggests that F. W. Watts, a feeble imitator
    of Constable, is the real author of this timidly executed painting—an
    attribution which is certainly more convincing than the one in the
    official catalogue. The <cite>Glebe Farm</cite> (No. 1810) tallies closely, as
    regards the superficial aspect, with the picture of the same title
    at the National Gallery, to which it is, however, so inferior as to
    put Constable’s authorship out of the question. <cite>The Windmill</cite> (No.
    1810<span class="smcap">a</span>), a gift of Mr. Sedelmeyer, seems to be a copy of
    the <cite>Spring</cite> at the Victoria and Albert Museum. <cite>The Rainbow</cite> (No.
    1807) may possibly be by Constable, although its authorship has been
    questioned by several reliable authorities.</p>

  <p>James Webb (1825?–1895), a painter of undeniable talent for imitating
    the manner of artists greater than himself, is beyond much doubt
    responsible both for the <cite>Landscape</cite> (No. 1820), which is officially
    given to Richard Wilson (1714–1782), and for the view of the <cite>Pont
    Neuf</cite> (No. 1819), which is still exhibited as an example by the
    greatest English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851).
    Unfortunately Turner’s name has to be added to Hogarth’s and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>Gainsborough’s in the list of eminent British masters who are not
    represented at the Louvre.</p>

  <h3 id="BONINGTON">BONINGTON</h3>

  <p>That Richard Parkes Bonington (1801–1828) should be seen to better
    advantage in this collection, is only natural in view of the fact
    that by his training at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and under
    Gros he belongs to the French rather than to the English school. He
    was closely allied by the bond of friendship to Delacroix, and played
    an important part in the romantic movement. The two little pictures
    <cite>François I. and the Duchesse d’Etampes</cite> (No. 1802) and <cite>Mazarin
    and Anne of Austria</cite> (No. 1803) are conceived quite in the spirit
    of the French Romanticists. Bonington’s genius as a colourist is,
    however, best displayed in the sparkling and animated <cite>View of Venice</cite>
    (No. 1805). Admirable, too, in their spontaneous freshness are the
    <cite>View of the Gardens at Versailles</cite> (No. 1804) and the <cite>View of the
    Coast of Normandy</cite> (No. 1804<span class="smcap">a</span>). <cite>The Old Governess</cite> (No.
    1805<span class="smcap">a</span>), one of Bonington’s rare attempts at portraiture,
    is remarkable for the accentuation of the modelling, which somehow
    suggests the broad treatment of the planes adopted by a wood-carver.</p>

  <p>The picture which is catalogued as <cite>La Halte</cite> (No. 1814), by George
    Morland (1763–1804), is merely a poor copy of that artist’s painting
    <cite>The Public-house Door</cite>, engraved by Ward. It was presented to the
    Louvre by the proprietors of the magazine <cite>L’Art</cite>.</p>

  <p>When we come to the great school of British portrait painting, we have
    to record at least two or three masterpieces worthy of being included
    in a great museum. A picture of unquestioned authenticity and great
    charm is the <cite>Portrait of Master Hare</cite> (No. 1818<span class="smcap">b</span>) by Sir
    Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), who in this, as in other similar pieces,
    proved himself the painter <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of childhood in all its
    innocence and ingenuousness, even though this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> picture is by no means
    impeccable as regards draughtsmanship. The <cite>Master Hare</cite> was bequeathed
    to the Louvre by Baron Alphonse de Rothschild in 1905. The badly
    repainted <cite>Portrait of a Lady</cite> (No. 1818<span class="smcap">a</span>) in a white dress,
    and with powdered hair, is certainly not the work of Sir Joshua, under
    whose name it figures in the catalogue.</p>

  <h3 id="RAEBURN">RAEBURN</h3>

  <p>Among the recent additions to the Louvre collection is the excellent
    life-size portrait of <cite>Captain Robert Hay of Spot</cite>, by Sir Henry
    Raeburn (1756–1823), which still hangs on a screen in Gallery XV. and
    has not yet been provided with a number. It is a full-length portrait
    of the sitter, in uniform of scarlet coat, white breeches, black
    gaiters, and fur busby, his hand resting upon his gun, standing against
    a conventional landscape background with a sky of characteristic tawny
    hue. The picture was formerly in the collection of Mr. Sanderson, at
    the sale of which, in 1908, it was bought by Messrs. Agnew for 650 gs.
    To Raeburn are also ascribed the extremely puzzling <cite>Portrait of an Old
    Sailor</cite> (No. 1817), which, in spite of certain technical affinities
    with the British eighteenth-century school, is so un-English in spirit
    that it would be rash to ascribe it to any master of that school; the
    negligeable <cite>Portrait of Anna Moore, Authoress</cite> (No. 1817<span class="smcap">a</span>);
    also the utterly commonplace and wretchedly drawn <cite>Mrs. Maconochie and
    Child</cite> (No. 1817<span class="smcap">b</span>), which was bought in 1904, together with
    the equally questionable <cite>Portrait of a Lady and a Young Boy</cite> (No.
    1812<span class="smcap">b</span>), by Hoppner, for £4000.</p>

  <h3 id="SIR_THOMAS_LAWRENCE">SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE</h3>

  <p>The strangely exaggerated estimation in which Sir Thomas Lawrence
    (1769–1830) is held by French connoisseurs, is to a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> extent
    to be accounted for by the superb quality of the picture by which he
    is best known in France: the portrait group of <cite>J. J. Angerstein and
    his Wife</cite> (No. 1813<span class="smcap">a</span>) at the Louvre, which was acquired in
    1896 for £3000. This fine group displays all his bravura and pleasing
    freshness and brightness of colour, without any of the vulgar tricks
    and shallow mannerisms of his later years. Next to it should be
    mentioned the charming half-length life-size <cite>Portrait of Mary Palmer</cite>
    (No. 1813<span class="smcap">c</span>), in a yellow dress, seated in a garden. The
    completely wrecked <cite>Portrait of Lord Whitworth, English Ambassador
    to France in 1802</cite> (No. 1813), and the <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite> (No.
    1813<span class="smcap">d</span>), are of no artistic significance.</p>

  <p>Neither is it necessary to dwell upon the mediocre <cite>Brother and
    Sister</cite> (No. 1801), by Sir William Beechey (1753–1839); the <cite>Portrait
    of Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Princess of Wales</cite> (No.
    1818), by Allan Ramsay (1713–1784); and the <cite>Portrait of Lamartine,
    French Poet and Politician</cite> (No. 1816<span class="smcap">a</span>), by Henry Wyndham
    Phillips (1820–1868). <cite>The Woman in White</cite> (No. 1816) is at least a
    sound piece of craftsmanship, even if the attribution to John Opie
    (1761–1807), “the Cornish Wonder,” is subject to doubt.</p>

  <h3 id="OTHER_PORTRAIT_PAINTERS">OTHER PORTRAIT PAINTERS</h3>

  <p>We have already mentioned the portrait group (No. 1812<span class="smcap">b</span>), a
    picture in deplorable condition, to which the name of John Hoppner
    (1758?–1810) has been attached without sufficient reason. No less
    doubtful is the authenticity of the <cite>Portrait of the Countess of
    Oxford</cite> (No. 1812<span class="smcap">a</span>), a meretricious picture which serves
    to show the mannerisms and striving after prettiness of Lawrence’s
    rival, rather than the more estimable qualities by which his better
    achievements are distinguished.</p>

  <p>George Romney (1734–1802), on the other hand, is seen in his
    most serious mood in the <cite>Portrait of Sir John Stanley</cite> (No.
    1818<span class="smcap">c</span>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>— a thoroughly honest “likeness,” well drawn, and
    painted straight-forwardly, without tricky accents and mechanical
    recipes. On a screen in Gallery XV. has been temporarily placed a
    recently acquired <cite>Portrait of the Artist</cite>, by Romney. He is seated,
    palette in hand, in a landscape background. The features are well
    modelled, and the light and shade managed with considerable skill.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough the most remarkable English picture at the Louvre
    is by a little known painter, who is not represented in any of the
    leading British galleries. Charles Howard Hodges (1764–1837), who was
    born in London, but went at the age of twenty-four to Holland, where
    he spent the rest of his life, was really a mezzotint engraver, in
    which craft he had been trained by John Raphael Smith. He produced many
    plates after pictures by the Dutch masters, and also painted a few
    portraits, among them the masterly <cite>Portrait of a Woman</cite> (No. 1812),
    at the Louvre. At a time which was too much given to conventionality
    and to the desire to please by concessions to a popular craving for
    prettiness, this picture strikes a note of almost brutal realism. It
    is painted with surprising vigour and with an appreciation of correct
    tone-values, in a low key, which heralds the art of the Glasgow school
    in the later decades of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>With <cite>The Bathing Woman</cite> (No. 1810<span class="smcap">b</span>), by William Etty
    (1787–1849), and <cite>The Watering Place</cite> (No. 1815), by William Mulready
    (1786–1863), we reach the full decadence of the British school in
    early Victorian days before the great revival initiated by the
    pre-Raphaelites.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
